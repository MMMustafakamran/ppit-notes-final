# Lecture 12b – Conflict Management and Negotiation

## 1. Understanding Conflict

### What Is Conflict?
- **Definition**: Disagreement or clash between parties with opposing interests, values, goals, or perspectives
- **Types**:
  - **Task conflict**: Disagreements about work content/goals/procedures
  - **Relationship conflict**: Personal incompatibilities and interpersonal tensions
  - **Process conflict**: Disagreements about how work should be done
  - **Value conflict**: Fundamental differences in beliefs/principles

### Sources in IT Environments
- Resource scarcity (budget, time, personnel)
- Competing priorities and deadlines
- Technical disagreements (architecture, tools, approaches)
- Role ambiguity and unclear responsibilities
- Personality clashes and communication styles
- Cultural differences in distributed teams
- Power struggles and organizational politics

### Conflict Can Be Constructive or Destructive
- **Destructive**: Stress, reduced productivity, damaged relationships, team dysfunction
- **Constructive**: Stimulates innovation, reveals problems early, improves decision-making, strengthens relationships

---

## 2. Conflict Management Styles (Thomas-Kilmann Model)

Five primary approaches based on **assertiveness** (concern for self) and **cooperativeness** (concern for others):

| Style | Assertiveness | Cooperativeness | When Appropriate | Risk |
|-------|--------------|----------------|------------------|------|
| **Competing** | High | Low | Quick decision needed, protecting vital interests | Damages relationships |
| **Accommodating** | Low | High | Issue more important to others, preserving harmony | May be taken advantage of |
| **Avoiding** | Low | Low | Issue trivial, cooling-off needed | Problems escalate |
| **Collaborating** | High | High | Both concerns important, commitment needed | Time-consuming |
| **Compromising** | Moderate | Moderate | Goals moderately important, equal power | May not fully satisfy either party |

---

## 3. Conflict Resolution Process

1. **Acknowledge the Conflict**: Recognize it exists, address early
2. **Define the Problem**: Identify root cause, separate facts from assumptions
3. **Gather Information**: Listen actively, ask clarifying questions, find common ground
4. **Generate Options**: Brainstorm solutions, focus on interests not positions
5. **Evaluate and Select Solution**: Assess against criteria, choose best option
6. **Implement and Follow Up**: Put solution into action, monitor progress

---

## 4. Communication Skills for Conflict Management

### Active Listening
- Give full attention, avoid interrupting

### Types of Negotiation
- **Distributive (Zero-Sum)**: Fixed pie, one party's gain is another's loss (e.g., salary negotiation)
- **Integrative (Win-Win)**: Expanding the pie, creating value for all parties (e.g., partnership agreements)

### Key Elements
- Parties with different interests
- Issues to be resolved
- Alternatives (BATNA)
- Constraints and deadlines
- Power dynamics

---

## 6. Negotiation Process

1. **Preparation**
   - Define goals and priorities
   - Research other party's interests
   - Determine BATNA (walk-away point)
   - Set target, reservation point, opening offer
   - Anticipate objections

2. **Opening**
   - Establish rapport
   - State position clearly
   - Listen to other party
   - Identify areas of agreement/disagreement

3. **Bargaining**
   - Make concessions strategically
   - Focus on interests, not positions
   - Explore creative options
   - Use objective criteria
   - Manage emotions

4. **Closing**

- **Extreme initial offers**: Starting high/low
- **Reluctant buyer/seller**: Showing hesitation
- **Nibbling**: Asking for small additional concessions at end

### Integrative Tactics
- **Expanding the pie**: Creating more value
- **Logrolling**: Trading off on different priorities
- **Bridging**: Creating new options satisfying both parties
- **Cost-cutting**: Reducing costs for one party without harming the other

### Common Mistakes
- Failing to prepare
- Focusing only on positions
- Getting emotional
- Talking too much, listening too little
- Making premature concessions
- Accepting first offer
- Ignoring BATNA
- Not putting agreements in writing

---

## 8. BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement)

### Definition
Your best option if negotiations fail. Determines your **reservation point** (minimum acceptable outcome).

### Importance
- Gives you power and confidence
- Helps you know when to walk away
- Prevents accepting bad deals
- Guides negotiation strategy

### Example (Job Offer Negotiation)

## 4. Business Model Canvas (Key Blocks)

### Customer-Facing
1. **Customer Segments**: Who you serve (B2C, B2B, B2G, multi-sided)
2. **Value Proposition**: Which problem you solve and why you're better
3. **Channels**: How you reach customers (web, app stores, partners, sales)
4. **Customer Relationships**: Self-service, communities, account managers, etc.
5. **Revenue Streams**: Subscriptions, ads, fees, licenses, services

### Internal
6. **Key Resources**: Team, tech, IP, brand, data
7. **Key Activities**: Building, operating, marketing, supporting the product
8. **Key Partners**: Cloud providers, payment processors, resellers, integrators
9. **Cost Structure**: Salaries, infra, marketing, support, compliance costs

---

## 5. Choosing and Evaluating a Model

### Key Questions
- Who pays and for what value?
- Does subscription, usage-based, or transaction-based pricing fit better?
- Is freemium realistic (can you support free users and still convert enough to paid)?
- Do network effects or marketplaces play a role?
- What are the acquisition costs?
- What are the support and operational costs?

### Watch Out For
- "Free forever" without a revenue path
- Over-reliance on ads without scale
- Ignoring acquisition, support, and regulatory costs
- Underestimating infrastructure costs
- Not considering customer lifetime value

### Regulatory Considerations
- In regulated verticals (finance, health, telecom, government), models must respect:
  - Laws and regulations
  - Privacy requirements
  - Sector-specific rules
  - Data protection (GDPR, CCPA, PDPL)
  - Compliance costs

## Key Takeaways - Week 12

1. **Conflict** is natural and can be constructive if managed well
2. **Five conflict management styles** (Thomas-Kilmann): Competing, Accommodating, Avoiding, Collaborating, Compromising
3. **Effective communication** (active listening, "I" statements, emotional intelligence) is fundamental
4. **Negotiation process**: Preparation, Opening, Bargaining, Closing, Implementation
5. **BATNA** determines your negotiation power
6. **Management** (POLC framework) vs. **Leadership** (influence and vision) - both needed
7. **Mentorship** develops others through guidance and knowledge sharing
8. **IT contexts** require technical credibility combined with management, leadership, and mentorship skills

---

## Exam Tips (Weeks 12–13)
- **Q1 MCQs**: Management (POLC), leadership vs. management, conflict styles (TKI), BATNA concept, negotiation stages, grapevine/communication basics, organizational structure types.
- **Q2 (Ethical Decision Making)**: If a scenario involves team conflict, harassment, or negotiation ethics, use the 4-step model; stakeholders include team, manager, client, HR; apply Consequentialism, Rights/Duties, Deontology.
- **Timing**: For any short answers (if asked), list 3–4 crisp points (e.g., BATNA definition + why it gives power).
- **Structures** (link to Q6 style problems): Be ready to recommend matrix/hybrid for cross-functional teams and justify with strategy/technology/size.
- **Common pitfalls**: Forgetting to mention BATNA; mixing up conflict style names; vague differences between management and leadership; not distinguishing distributive vs. integrative negotiation.

9. **Common models**: License, SaaS, Freemium, Advertising, Marketplace, Usage-based, Open Source
10. **Business Model Canvas** helps design and evaluate business models

---

## Exam Tips (Week 13)
- **Q1 MCQs**: Agile values/principles, Scrum roles/events/artifacts, XP practices (TDD, pair programming, CI, refactoring), story points/velocity, business model definitions (business model vs. revenue model vs. value proposition), vertical vs. horizontal solutions.
- **Short answers**: If asked to differentiate business/revenue model/value proposition, keep to one-line definitions from the study guide.
- **Scenario prep**: For a simple design/organization question, propose an agile approach with sprints, backlog, and demos; justify with “responding to change” and “frequent delivery.”
- **Pitfalls**: Calling “Agile = no documentation”; confusing Product Owner vs. Scrum Master; skipping Definition of Done; mixing revenue model with business model.

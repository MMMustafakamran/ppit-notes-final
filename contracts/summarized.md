# Contracts Summary

## I. Fundamentals of Contracts

### 1. Definitions

* **Agreement:** Every promise or set of promises forming consideration for each other. It is not necessarily bound by law.

* **Contract:** An agreement between two or more persons (legal or natural) that is **enforceable in a court of law**.

* **Essential Elements:**
  * **Offer:** Expression of intention to create a binding agreement.
  * **Acceptance:** Must mirror the offer and be reasonable.
  * **Consideration:** "Legal detriment" to both sides; each party must give/receive something (e.g., money for services).

### 2. Contract Terms

* **Express Terms:** Details agreed upon between parties sufficient for enforcement.
* **Implied Terms:** Terms implied by law.
* **Warranties:** Promises or undertakings regarding the product/service. Can also include a **Disclaimer of Warranties** to limit rights/obligations.

### 3. Specific Issues in Computer Contracts

IT contracts are complex due to:

* **Intangible Property:** Software is not a physical good.
* **Intellectual Property (IP):** Risks regarding copyright/patent infringement.
* **System Failures:** Risk of not meeting requirements or organizational growth, leading to damage claims.

> **Case Study: Ministry of Information vs. Faujisoft (2001)**
> 
> A project failed due to poor contracting. No formal requirements were provided by the client; the vendor (Faujisoft) wrote the contract and specs. The software delivered was buggy and unusable, but the client could not claim damages because the contract terms protected the vendor.

## II. Structure and Clauses of a Software Contract

A standard software contract is structured into an **Introductory Section** (definitions, parties), a **Clause Section** (terms), and an **Authority Section** (signatures).

**Key Clauses:**

* **Scope/Requirements:** Must refer to a detailed specification document (complete, consistent, accurate) to define what is to be produced.
* **Deliverables:** Not just code. Includes source code, command files, documentation (design/code), manuals (user/training), and test data.
* **Ownership of Rights (IP):** Must state who owns the IP (software house vs. client). Physical items (disks) pass to the client, but IP rights must be explicitly transferred or licensed.
* **Confidentiality:** Protects client's business info and software house's code secrets.
* **Client Obligations:** Client must provide documentation, staff access, hardware facilities, and data connections. Failure can make the client liable for delays.
* **Standards:** Specifies if the supplier's or client's QA procedures and working methods apply.
* **Project Managers:** Each party nominates a PM in writing with defined financial authority to authorize changes.
* **Acceptance Procedure:** Critical for completion. Based on a fixed set of tests and expected results.
* **Indemnity:** Protection against costs if one party causes the other to infringe on third-party IP rights.
* **Termination:** Provisions for ending the contract (e.g., client takeover, policy change).
* **Arbitration:** Agreement to use an independent arbitrator to resolve disputes instead of litigation.
* **Inflation:** Allows charge increases based on rising costs for long-term projects.

## III. Types of Software Contracts

### 1. Fixed Price Contracts for Bespoke Systems

* **Definition:** Tailor-made systems with a set price.

* **Payment Terms:**
  * Typically due within 30 days of invoice.
  * **Standard Breakdown:** 15% on signature, up to 65% during development (stage payments), 25% on acceptance, 10% after warranty.
  * **Penalties:** Late payments may incur interest (e.g., 2% above base rate).

* **Delay/Change Payments:**
  * **Penalty Clauses:** For delays caused by the supplier (suppliers often resist this).
  * **Client Liability:** If the client fails to meet obligations (e.g., providing access), they are liable for delay payments.

* **Warranty:**
  * Cost varies with duration (longer warranty = higher cost).
  * Post-warranty maintenance is usually on a "Time and Materials" basis.

### 2. Consultancy and Contract Hire

* **Contract Hire:** Supplier provides staff at daily/hourly rates. Simple contract. "Body shopping".
* **Consultancy:** "Up-market" version of contract hire. Experts provide assessment/advice. Usually fixed price.
* **Issues:** Liability for bad advice (minimized via professional liability insurance) and Terms of Reference (scope definition).

### 3. 'Cost Plus' Contracts (Time and Materials)

* **Definition:** Development is done like a fixed price contract, but payment is based on *actual* costs incurred plus labor charges.
* **Usage:** Used when work cannot be specified in advance (e.g., R&D).

### 4. Outsourcing Contracts (Facilities Management)

* **Definition:** Customer hands over planning, management, and operations of functions to a supplier to focus on core competencies.
* **Key Issues:** Asset/staff transfer, performance monitoring, disaster recovery, and termination provisions.

### 5. Web Hosting Contracts

* **Services:** Collocation vs. Hosting, SEO, Online promotion.
* **Service Levels (SLAs):** Uptime, response time, redundancy, user support, and security.

### 6. License Agreements

* **Restrictions:** Limits how the customer uses software.
  * **Desktop:** Single copy (retail games).
  * **Server:** Multiple copies per server (databases).
  * **Site:** Multiple copies at a specific location.

### 7. Legal Acts & Insurance

* **Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977:** Limits ability to avoid liability for negligence via contract clauses.
* **Health and Safety Act 1974:** Employers must protect health/welfare of employees and visitors (including contractors).
* **Product Liability Insurance:** Covers injury/damage caused by products.
* **Professional Liability Insurance (Errors & Omissions):** Protects against negligence claims regarding professional advice.

## IV. Employment and Contractor Agreements

### 1. Employment Contracts

* **Definition:** Outlines rights, responsibilities, pay, duties, and termination procedures.

* **Types:**
  * **Permanent Full Time:** No end date, full hours.
  * **Permanent Part Time:** No end date, fewer hours.
  * **Fixed Period/Term:** Prearranged end date; expires automatically.

* **Probationary Period:** Usually 3+ months to assess fit. Termination during this period requires no notice or severance.

### 2. Restrictive Clauses

* **Non-Compete:** Prevents working for direct competitors for a specific time/location after termination.
* **Non-Solicitation:** Prevents poaching clients or other employees.
* **Confidentiality:** Bars discussion of trade secrets/marketing plans. Can be indefinite or fixed-term.

### 3. Confidentiality Agreements (NDAs)

* **Purpose:** Protects Customer Info, IP (patents, trade secrets), Marketing, and Business Operations data.
* **Enforceability:** Valid if terms are not too broad, do not unfairly restrict the party, and information is not already public.

### 4. Independent Contractor Agreement

* **Definition:** Contract with a self-employed individual (freelancer) providing a service for money.

* **Key Distinctions:**
  * **Contractor:** Uses own tools, has multiple clients, pays own taxes, no benefits, fixed-term.
  * **Employee:** Employer controls work details/wages, receives benefits (medical/vacation), signed employment contract.

* **Risks:** Misclassifying an employee as a contractor can lead to fines from the DOL/IRS and tax penalties.

* **IP Ownership:** Under copyright law, "Work for hire" belongs to the person commissioning the work (the client), not the creator, unless specified otherwise.

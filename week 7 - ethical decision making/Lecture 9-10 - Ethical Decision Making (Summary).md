# Ethical Decision-Making in IT - Summary

> **EXAM FOCUS**: This topic is worth **25 marks in Q2** - the entire question focuses on the 4-step ethical decision-making process. Master this framework thoroughly!

---

## 1. Why Structured Ethical Decision-Making Matters

### Problems with Unstructured Decisions
- **Emotional bias** - ignoring facts, acting on impulse
- **Inconsistency** - similar cases handled differently
- **Harm to people** - loss of trust, privacy violations, unfair treatment
- **Organizational damage** - low morale, lawsuits, reputational crises
- **Missed accountability** - no clear reasoning to defend choices

### Benefits of Structured Approach
- Ensures careful examination of facts
- Applies principles consistently
- Balances interests of multiple stakeholders
- Builds defensible, transparent outcomes

**Key Point**: Technology creates new dilemmas daily (AI, privacy, cybersecurity). Laws lag behind technology. Many issues are shades of grey, not simply right or wrong.

---

## 2. Value Judgment in Ethical Decisions

Every ethical dilemma requires judgment about:
- Whose interests matter most?
- Which rights or duties take precedence?
- What is "good" or "just"?
- How to balance competing values?

**Without judgment**: Decisions risk being random, legalistic, or emotional.

**Goal**: Principled, defensible choice that can be explained and justified.

---

## 3. Factors Influencing Behavior

Three layers interact:
1. **Biological Needs** - food, shelter, safety, love
2. **Social Influences** - rules, culture, religion, family, government
3. **Moral/Ethical Understanding** - what we believe is good, right, just

**Behavior = Outcome of all layers interacting**

Ethical dilemmas arise when these influences conflict.

---

## 4. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

**From bottom to top:**
1. **Physiological** - breathing, food, water, shelter, sleep
2. **Safety** - health, employment, property, stability
3. **Social** - friendship, family, intimacy, connection
4. **Self-Esteem** - confidence, achievement, respect
5. **Self-Actualization** - morality, creativity, purpose, inner potential

**Key Principle**: Lower needs must be satisfied before higher needs motivate behavior.

**Relevance**: Understanding motivation helps predict behavior; ethical dilemmas may arise when needs conflict.

---

## 5. Approaches to Ethical Decision-Making

### A. Law and Ethics
**Start by asking**: Does the law provide a clear answer?

**Key Questions**:
- Does the law address this situation?
- Do I need professional/legal advice?

**Examples**: GDPR compliance, export control laws, copyright laws

**Limitation**: Legal compliance ≠ ethical behavior; laws may lag behind technology

### B. Informal Guidelines (Quick Tests)
**Use when**: Decisions need to be made quickly

**The Tests**:
1. **Secrecy Test** - Is anyone asking me to keep this quiet?
2. **Mom Test** - Would I be proud to tell my mother?
3. **TV Test** - Would I be comfortable if this appeared on news?
4. **Market Test** - Could this be advertised as a selling point?
5. **Smell Test** - Does something feel "off" instinctively?

**Examples**: Hiding bugs before release (Secrecy), sharing user data (TV Test), biased AI (Smell Test)

### C. Formal Guidelines (Explicit Standards)
**Key Questions**:
- Does this violate corporate policy?
- Does it align with ACM/IEEE Code of Ethics?
- Does it follow the Golden Rule?

**Golden Rule**: Would I accept this if roles were reversed?

**Examples**: Password sharing policy, IEEE "avoid harm" principle

## 6. Ethical Decision-Making Models (Overview)

| Model | Key Focus | Use Case |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **4-Step Model** | Recognize → Define → Evaluate → Decide | **PRIMARY MODEL FOR EXAM** |
| Rest's Model | Awareness → Judgment → Intention → Action | Psychology/moral development |
| PLUS Model | Policies, Legal, Universal, Self-test | Compliance training |
| Nash's 12 Questions | Deep reflection questions | Business ethics |
| Tucker's 5 Questions | Profitable? Legal? Fair? Right? Sustainable? | Managerial decisions |
| Kitchener's Principles | Autonomy, Beneficence, Non-maleficence, Justice, Fidelity | Healthcare/counseling |

**EXAM NOTE**: Focus on the **4-Step Model** - this is what Q2 tests!

## 7. The 4-Step Decision-Making Framework ⭐ **EXAM CRITICAL**

> **This entire framework is worth 25 marks in Q2. Master every step!**

### Step I: Understanding the Situation

#### A. List and number the relevant facts
- **Neutral and logical exercise**
- **Do NOT judge facts at this stage**
- Just state what is known
- Number each fact clearly

**EXAM TIP**: List 10-15 facts. Don't miss any relevant information from the scenario.

#### B. Which facts raise ethical issues? Why? What is the potential harm?
- Identify each ethical issue
- Explain why it's an ethical issue
- Describe potential or resulting harm

**EXAM TIP**: Look for discrimination, privacy violations, safety risks, conflicts of interest, pressure to act unethically.

#### C. List the stakeholders
- Individuals or groups affected by the situation
- Include both directly and indirectly affected parties

**EXAM TIP**: Think broadly - applicants, employees, management, customers, society, industry, regulators, etc.

---

### Step II: Isolating the Major Ethical Dilemma

**Identify the core ethical question** that needs to be resolved.

**Format**: "Should [person/entity] [action] or [alternative action]?"

**The Ethical Conflict**:
- What values are in conflict?
- What rights/duties compete?
- What are the two main alternatives?

**EXAM TIP**: Frame this as a clear yes/no or either/or question. This becomes the focus of Step III analysis.

---

### Step III: Analyzing the Ethicality of Both Alternatives

> **EXAM CRITICAL**: You MUST use ALL THREE frameworks. Each provides different perspective.

#### A. CONSEQUENTIALISM (Utilitarian Analysis)
**Focus**: Outcomes and consequences - which produces best overall results?

**Questions**:
- **A.** If action is done, who will be harmed?
- **B.** If action is NOT done, who will be harmed?
- **C.** Which is preferable, A or B?
- **D.** If action is done, who will benefit?
- **E.** If action is NOT done, who will benefit?
- **F.** Which is preferable, D or E?
- **G.** Which produces greatest good for greatest number?

**EXAM TIP**: 
- Consider both short-term and long-term consequences
- Think about harm to individuals AND society
- When frameworks agree, decision is stronger

#### B. RIGHTS AND DUTIES
**Focus**: What rights do stakeholders have? What duties do we owe them?

**Questions**:
1. What rights do stakeholders have?
2. What duties do we have toward stakeholders?
3. Which rights/duties take precedence when they conflict?
4. Does the action respect fundamental rights?
5. Does the action fulfill our duties?

**EXAM TIP**:
- Fundamental rights (fairness, non-discrimination) usually take precedence over efficiency
- Professional duties to prevent harm override organizational pressure
- Rights to fair treatment cannot be compromised

#### C. DEONTOLOGY (Kant's Categorical Imperative)
**Focus**: Duties and rules - can this action be universalized?

**Questions**:
- **H.** If action is done, who will be treated with disrespect?
- **I.** If action is NOT done, who will be treated with disrespect?
- **J.** Which is preferable, H or I?
- **K.** If action is done, who will be treated unlike others?
- **L.** If action is NOT done, who will be treated unlike others?
- **M.** Which is preferable, K or L?
- **N.** Are there benefits if everyone did this action?
- **O.** Are there benefits if nobody did this action?
- **P.** Which is preferable, N or O?

**EXAM TIP**:
- Universalization test: Would it be okay if everyone acted this way?
- Equal treatment is fundamental principle
- Actions that discriminate cannot be universalized

**KEY POINT**: When all three frameworks point to the same conclusion, the decision is very strong.

### Step IV: Making Decision and Planning Implementation

#### A. Make defensible ethical decision
- Based on Step III analysis
- Indicate which frameworks support your decision (A-G, 1-5, H-P)
- Justify your choice
- Resolve conflicting rights/duties by explaining which take precedence

**EXAM TIP**: 
- Be clear and direct: "Should/Should not..."
- Reference specific analysis from Step III
- Explain why fundamental rights/duties take precedence

#### B. List specific implementation steps
- 5-8 concrete, actionable steps
- Be specific, not vague
- Include: documentation, escalation, policy, suspension, audit, retraining, oversight, communication

**EXAM TIP**: 
- Number each step
- Make steps actionable ("Document findings" not "Think about it")
- Include both immediate and follow-up actions

#### C. Show how major stakeholders are affected
- For each stakeholder group, explain:
  - Positive impacts
  - Benefits
  - Challenges/negative impacts (if any)

**EXAM TIP**: 
- Go through each stakeholder from Step I.C
- Be balanced - acknowledge both benefits and challenges
- Show you understand the full impact

#### D. Longer-term preventive changes
**Categories to consider**:
1. **Technical** - bias testing, audits, standards
2. **Organizational** - ethics codes, review boards, training, culture
3. **Legal/Compliance** - legislation, industry standards, regulations
4. **Cultural** - ethical engineering culture, open discussion, recognition
5. **Societal** - public awareness, education, diversity
6. **Industry** - collaboration, best practices, professional organizations

**EXAM TIP**: 
- Think across multiple dimensions
- Be specific about what should change
- Explain how each change prevents future problems

#### E. What should have been done at the pivot point?
- Identify the point where the problem could have been prevented
- Explain what should have been done differently
- Focus on prevention, not reaction

**EXAM TIP**: 
- Usually at design/planning stage
- Think: ethical impact assessment, diverse data, bias testing, cross-functional teams
- Show understanding that prevention is better than reaction

## 8. Case Study: Amazon AI Hiring Tool (Example)

### The Situation
- AI tool trained on 10 years of Amazon hiring data (male-dominated)
- Tool downgrades résumés from women
- Alex discovers bias, manager wants to deploy anyway
- Pressure to meet deadlines

### Step I Analysis
**Facts**: 16 key facts identified
**Ethical Issues**: Gender discrimination, perpetuating bias, pressure to deploy, lack of accountability
**Stakeholders**: Female applicants, male applicants, Alex, manager, Amazon leadership, HR, society, tech industry

### Step II Dilemma
Should Alex approve rollout of biased tool or refuse/advocate for fixing bias first?

### Step III Analysis
**Consequentialism**: Not rolling out = less harm, more benefit
**Rights/Duties**: Right to fair treatment takes precedence over efficiency
**Deontology**: Cannot universalize discrimination; fairness must be preserved

### Step IV Decision
**Decision**: Do NOT approve rollout

**Implementation**: Document findings, escalate, suspend rollout, audit, retrain, human oversight, communicate

**Prevention**: Ethical impact assessment at design stage, diverse training data, bias testing throughout development

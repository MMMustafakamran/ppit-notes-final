### 4-Step Ethical Decision Making Framework ⭐⭐⭐

#### Step I: Understanding the Situation
1. **List relevant facts** (10-15 facts, numbered)
   - Neutral, logical exercise
   - Do NOT judge at this stage
   - Just state what is known
2. **Identify ethical issues** (4-6 issues)
   - Why it's an ethical issue
   - Potential or resulting harm
   - Look for: discrimination, privacy violations, safety risks, conflicts of interest
3. **List stakeholders** (8-10 stakeholders)
   - Directly and indirectly affected parties
   - Think broadly: applicants, employees, management, customers, society, industry, regulators

#### Step II: Isolating the Major Ethical Dilemma
- Format: "Should [person/entity] [action] or [alternative action]?"
- Identify core ethical conflict
- What values/rights/duties compete?
- Frame as clear either/or question

#### Step III: Analyzing Ethicality (BOTH ALTERNATIVES) ⚠️

**A. CONSEQUENTIALISM (Utilitarian Analysis)**
- A. If action done, who harmed?
- B. If action NOT done, who harmed?
- C. Which preferable, A or B?
- D. If action done, who benefits?
- E. If action NOT done, who benefits?
- F. Which preferable, D or E?
- G. Which produces greatest good for greatest number?
- Consider both short-term and long-term consequences

**B. RIGHTS AND DUTIES**
1. What rights do stakeholders have?
2. What duties do we have toward stakeholders?
3. Which rights/duties take precedence when they conflict?

## 12. CONFLICT MANAGEMENT & NEGOTIATION

### Conflict Management Styles (Thomas-Kilmann)

| Style | Assertiveness | Cooperativeness | When Appropriate |
|-------|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Competing** | High | Low | Quick decision, protecting vital interests |
| **Accommodating** | Low | High | Issue more important to others, preserving harmony |
| **Avoiding** | Low | Low | Issue trivial, cooling-off needed |
| **Collaborating** | High | High | Both concerns important, commitment needed |
| **Compromising** | Moderate | Moderate | Goals moderately important, equal power |

### Types of Conflict
- **Task Conflict**: Disagreement about work content/goals/methods (can be constructive)
- **Relationship Conflict**: Personal incompatibilities, personality clashes (usually destructive)
- **Process Conflict**: Disagreement about how work should be done (can be constructive or destructive)
- **Value Conflict**: Fundamental differences in beliefs/principles

### Conflict Resolution Process
1. Acknowledge the Conflict
2. Define the Problem
3. Gather Information
4. Generate Options
5. Evaluate and Select Solution
6. Implement and Follow Up

### Negotiation Process
1. **Preparation**: Define goals, research other party, determine BATNA, set target/reservation/opening
2. **Opening**: Establish rapport, state position, listen, identify agreement/disagreement
3. **Bargaining**: Make concessions strategically, focus on interests not positions, explore options
4. **Closing**: Summarize agreements, confirm understanding, put in writing
5. **Implementation**: Follow through, monitor progress, maintain relationship

### BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement)
- Your best option if negotiations fail
- Determines your **reservation point** (minimum acceptable outcome)
- **Stronger BATNA = More leverage**

### Types of Negotiation
- **Distributive (Zero-Sum)**: Fixed pie, one party's gain is another's loss (e.g., salary)
- **Integrative (Win-Win)**: Expanding the pie, creating value for all (e.g., partnerships)

# 📚 PART 2: MEDIUM PRIORITY TOPICS (25 Marks)

## 14. BUSINESS MODELS & REVENUE MODELS (Q1: Q1, Q20, Q24)

### Key Definitions
- **Revenue Model**: Framework for generating income (NOT same as business model)
- **Business Model**: Overall approach to creating, delivering, and capturing value
- **Value Proposition**: Promise of value to be delivered to customer (NOT same as business model or revenue model)

### Common Business Models

| Model | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Freemium** | Free basic tier, paid premium features | Dropbox, Spotify |
| **Donationware** | Software supported by donations | Open source projects |
| **Crippleware** | Limited version to encourage purchase | Trial software |

| **Data-Driven/Analytics** | Sell insights or data products | Analytics platforms |

### Key Distinctions (Important for MCQs)
- **Revenue Model ≠ Business Model**: Revenue model is framework for generating income; business model is overall approach to creating/delivering/capturing value
- **Value Proposition ≠ Business Model ≠ Revenue Model**: Value proposition is promise of value to customer
- **Freemium**: Some features free, advanced features require premium/payment (NOT commission model, donationware, or crippleware)

### Business Model Canvas (Key Blocks)
- **Customer Segments**: Who you serve (B2C, B2B, B2G, multi-sided)
- **Value Proposition**: Which problem you solve and why you're better
- **Channels**: How you reach customers (web, app stores, partners, sales)
- **Customer Relationships**: Self-service, communities, account managers
- **Revenue Streams**: Subscriptions, ads, fees, licenses, services
- **Key Resources**: Team, tech, IP, brand, data
- **Key Activities**: Building, operating, marketing, supporting the product

## 16. AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

### Agile Manifesto - Four Values
1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

### Core Principles
- Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
- Welcome changing requirements (even late in development)
- Business people and developers work together daily
- Build projects around motivated individuals
- Face-to-face conversation is most effective
- Working software is primary measure of progress
- Sustainable development pace
- Continuous attention to technical excellence
- Simplicity—maximizing work not done
- Self-organizing teams
- Regular reflection and adjustment (retrospectives)

### Scrum Overview

**Roles:**
- **Product Owner**: Owns backlog, prioritizes by value, represents stakeholders
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates process, removes impediments, protects team
- **Development Team**: Cross-functional, self-organizing, delivers increments

**Events:**
- **Sprint** (1-4 weeks): Timeboxed iteration, potentially shippable increment
- **Sprint Planning**: Team selects backlog items, plans work
- **Daily Scrum**: 15-minute daily meeting (What did I do? What will I do? Impediments?)
- **Sprint Review**: Demo of completed work, stakeholder feedback
- **Sprint Retrospective**: Team reflects on process, identifies improvements

**Artifacts:**
- **Product Backlog**: Ordered list of all work
- **Sprint Backlog**: Selected items for sprint
- **Increment**: Sum of completed items (must meet Definition of Done)

### XP (Extreme Programming) Practices
- **TDD** (Test-Driven Development): Write tests first
- **Pair Programming**: Two developers work together
- **Continuous Integration**: Frequent code integration and testing
- **Refactoring**: Continuously improve code structure
- **Simple Design**: Design for current needs
- **Collective Code Ownership**: Anyone can modify any code

### Estimation & Planning
- **Story Points**: Relative estimation (Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
- **Velocity**: Story points finished per sprint (used for forecasting)
- **User Stories**: Capture requirements from user's perspective
- **Product Backlog**: Prioritized by value/risk; refined continuously

### Benefits and Challenges
- **Benefits**: Faster, incremental value delivery; better alignment with real user needs; higher transparency and adaptability; continuous improvement
- **Challenges**: Cultural change; risk of misinterpreting Agile as "no planning/documentation"; coordination harder in large or highly regulated environments; needs discipline and good engineering

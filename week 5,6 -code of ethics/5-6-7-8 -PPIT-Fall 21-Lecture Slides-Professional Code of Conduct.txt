INTRODUCTION TO PROFESSIONAL CODE OF CONDUCT
================================================================================

What is Professional Ethics?
----------------------------
Professional ethics refers to the moral principles and standards that guide the behavior of professionals in their work. For computing professionals, this includes:

- Ethical decision-making in software development
- Responsibility to clients, users, and society
- Maintaining professional integrity and competence
- Respecting privacy and confidentiality
- Ensuring the safety and security of systems

Why Professional Ethics Matter in Computing
-------------------------------------------
- Computing professionals have significant impact on society
- Software affects millions of users daily
- Ethical failures can cause harm, discrimination, or privacy violations
- Professional reputation and trust depend on ethical behavior
- Legal compliance alone is not sufficient; ethical behavior goes beyond legal requirements

# Lecture 12 – Organization Structures and Cultures (Summary)

## 1. What Is Organizational Behavior?

### Definition
- **Organizational Behavior (OB)**: Study of how individuals, groups, and structures affect and influence behavior within an organization
- **Purpose**: Use this knowledge to make organizations more effective and human-centered

### Three Levels of OB

| Level | Focus | Example |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Individual Level** | Attitudes, motivation, perception, personality, job satisfaction | Why one developer feels demotivated working under a rigid manager |
| **Group Level** | Communication, teamwork, leadership, power, conflict | How a software team collaborates or clashes during a sprint |
| **Organizational Level** | Structure, culture, policies, and design | How DPL's flat culture and "no sir/bhai" rule shapes behavior |

---

## 2. Organization Structure

### Definition
- **Organizational Structure**: The formal system that defines how tasks are divided, grouped, and coordinated within an organization
- **Purpose**: Describes how people and work are organized to achieve common goals

### Six Key Questions That Determine Structure
1. To what degree are tasks subdivided into separate jobs?
2. On what basis will jobs be grouped together?
3. To whom do individuals and groups report?
4. How many individuals can a manager efficiently and effectively direct?
5. Where does decision-making authority lie?
6. To what degree will there be rules and regulations to direct employees and managers?

## 3. Key Elements of Organizational Structure

| Element | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Work Specialization** | Division of tasks into specific jobs | Separate DevOps, Design, and Sales roles |
| **Departmentalization** | Grouping jobs by function, product, or geography | IT Dept., Finance Dept., or Product Teams |
| **Chain of Command** | Who reports to whom | CEO → Managers → Teams |
| **Span of Control** | Number of people a manager supervises | Wide span = more autonomy; narrow = close control |
| **Centralization / Decentralization** | Where decisions are made | DPL = decentralized (team decisions) |
| **Formalization** | Degree of rules and procedures | Startups = low formalization; banks = high |

---

## 4. Why Do Organization Structures Differ?

| Factor | Explanation | Example (Pakistan / Global) |
|--------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **Strategy** | Structure must support company's goals and strategy | DPL uses flat, flexible structure for innovation; State Bank uses hierarchical structure for control |
| **Size** | Small companies are simple; large companies need more specialization | Startup with 10 people has one manager; telecom with 10,000 needs multiple levels |
| **Technology** | Complexity affects coordination needs | Software companies use agile teams; manufacturing uses process-based departments |
| **Environment** | Stable environments allow centralized structures; dynamic need flexibility | Government offices = stable; tech startups = dynamic |
| **Culture and Leadership** | Some leaders prefer control; others value autonomy | DPL's people-first culture → flat structure; authoritarian leaders → tall structures |
| **Geography** | Multiple regions often adopt divisional structures | Multinationals like Unilever have separate divisions for Pakistan, UAE, UK |
| **Legal and Regulatory** | Some sectors require formal hierarchies | NADRA, SECP, SBP have regulated, layered structures |

## 5. Common Types of Organizational Structures

| Type | Description | Example | Key Characteristics |
|------|-------------|---------|---------------------|
| **Simple Structure** | Few layers, one central decision-maker | Small startups | Low formalization, wide span, centralized |
| **Functional Structure** | Organized by departments (HR, Tech, Sales) | Mid-sized software houses | Groups by function, clear chain of command |
| **Divisional / Product** | Based on products or clients | Project teams (IoT, AI, Web) | Self-contained divisions, product-focused |
| **Matrix Structure** | Employees report to both functional and project managers | Consulting or large engineering firms | Dual reporting, project-based |
| **Flat Structure** | Minimal hierarchy, wide control span | DPL's "Rebel Culture" | Few levels, decentralized, empowered teams |
| **Hierarchical (Tall)** | Many levels of management, clear authority chain | Government departments, traditional corporates | Multiple layers, narrow span, centralized |
| **Network Structure** | Relies on external partners and contractors | Some tech companies outsourcing | Core organization with network of partners |
| **Team-based Structure** | Organization built around teams | Agile organizations | Cross-functional teams, collaborative |

---

## 6. Tall vs. Flat Organizations

| Feature | Tall | Flat |
|---------|------|------|
| **Levels** | Many | Few |
| **Decision Speed** | Slow | Fast |
| **Control** | Tight supervision | Empowered teams |
| **Communication** | Top-down | Open and horizontal |
| **Example** | NADRA, Banks | DPL, Netflix |
| **Characteristics** | Bureaucratic, hierarchical, formal | Flexible, informal, empowered |
| **Advantages** | Clear authority, career paths, control | Fast decisions, empowerment, communication |
| **Disadvantages** | Slow, bureaucratic, communication barriers | Less structure, potential chaos, limited career paths |

---

## 7. Product Organization Structure

### Characteristics
- Each product division operates as semi-autonomous unit
- Divisions have their own functional departments (marketing, sales, development)
- Product managers have significant authority
- Focus on product success and customer satisfaction

### Advantages
- Clear product accountability
- Focus on product success
- Flexibility to adapt products
- Cross-functional collaboration within divisions

### Disadvantages
- Duplication of resources across divisions
- Potential competition between divisions
- Coordination challenges
- Higher costs

### Structure Example
- Product A Division (Marketing, Sales, Development teams)
- Product B Division (Marketing, Sales, Development teams)
- Product C Division (Marketing, Sales, Development teams)
- Each division reports to top management

---

## 8. What Is Organizational Culture?

### Definition
- **Organizational Culture**: The shared system of values, beliefs, norms, and behaviors that shapes how people within an organization think, feel, and act
- **Metaphor**: The "personality" of an organization — the invisible force that defines how things are done around here

### Components
- **Values**: What the organization considers important
- **Beliefs**: Assumptions about how things work
- **Norms**: Unwritten rules of behavior
- **Behaviors**: Observable actions and practices
- **Symbols**: Visible representations of culture

---

## 9. What Do Cultures Do?

### Five Key Functions
1. **Defines the Boundary**: Creates distinction between one organization and others
2. **Conveys a Sense of Identity**: Helps members understand who they are
3. **Facilitates Commitment**: Generates commitment to something larger than self-interest
4. **Enhances Stability**: Provides stability to the social system
5. **Sense-Making and Control**: Serves as sense-making mechanism and controls employee behavior

---

## 10. Characteristics of Organizational Culture

| Characteristic | Description | Example |
|----------------|-------------|---------|
| **Innovation & Risk-taking** | Encourages new ideas and experimentation | DPL teams trying new AI tools without fear of failure |
| **Attention to Detail** | Emphasizes precision and quality | QA and code review processes |
| **Outcome Orientation** | Focus on results rather than procedures | Performance based on delivery, not hours |
| **People Orientation** | Values employee well-being and respect | Flat hierarchy, flexible work policy |
| **Team Orientation** | Promotes collaboration | Cross-functional product pods |
| **Aggressiveness** | Competitive and ambitious attitude | Sales and growth teams pursuing bold targets |
| **Stability** | Desire for order and consistency | Corporate HR processes, documentation |

---

## 11. Schein's Model of Organizational Culture

### Three Levels (Developed by Edgar Schein, 1980)

| Level | Description | Examples | Characteristics |
|-------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Artifacts and Symbols** (Visible) | The "visible" symbols of the culture | Logos, architecture, structure, business processes, corporate clothing | Observable, tangible, easy to see |
| **Espoused Values** (Stated) | The company's declared set of values and norms | Mission statements, value statements, public declarations | Stated beliefs, official values, public statements |
| **Basic Underlying Assumptions** (Deepest) | The bedrock of organizational culture; beliefs used for day-to-day decisions | Deeply embedded beliefs, unconscious assumptions | Deeply embedded, often unconscious, taken for granted, hardest to change |

**Key Insight**: Culture is like an iceberg — visible elements (artifacts) are above water, but the foundation (assumptions) is below and most important.

## 12. Do Organizations Have Uniform Culture?

### Dominant Culture
- **Definition**: Expresses the core values shared by a majority of the organization's members
- **Characteristics**: Main culture, widely shared, represents the organization
- **Function**: Provides overall identity and direction
- **Example**: DPL's "Rebel Culture" as the dominant culture

### Subcultures
- **Definition**: Minicultures within an organization, typically defined by department designations and geographical separation
- **Characteristics**: Smaller groups, may have different values, exist within larger culture
- **Types**: Departmental, geographic, functional subcultures
- **Example**: Engineering subculture vs. Sales subculture within same company

### Core Values
- **Definition**: The primary or dominant values accepted throughout the organization
- **Characteristics**: Fundamental beliefs, widely shared, enduring
- **Function**: Guide behavior and decision-making

### Strong Culture
- **Definition**: A culture in which core values are intensely held and widely shared
- **Characteristics**: Clear values, strong commitment, consistent behavior
- **Benefits**: High performance, strong commitment, clear direction
- **Challenges**: May resist change, potential for groupthink

## 15. Relationship Between Structure and Culture

### How Structure Influences Culture
- **Hierarchical structures** → Formal, controlled culture
- **Flat structures** → Informal, empowered culture
- **Functional structures** → Departmental subcultures
- **Matrix structures** → Collaborative, flexible culture

### How Culture Influences Structure
- **Innovation culture** → Flexible, adaptive structures
- **Stability culture** → Hierarchical, formal structures
- **People-oriented culture** → Flat, team-based structures
- **Control-oriented culture** → Tall, centralized structures

### Alignment
- Structure and culture should align
- Mismatch creates problems
- Both should support organizational goals
- Changes in one may require changes in the other

# Lecture 12b – Conflict Management and Negotiation (Summary)

## 1. Understanding Conflict

### What Is Conflict?
- **Definition**: Disagreement or clash between parties with opposing interests, values, goals, or perspectives
- **Types**:
  - **Task conflict**: Disagreements about work content/goals/procedures
  - **Relationship conflict**: Personal incompatibilities and interpersonal tensions
  - **Process conflict**: Disagreements about how work should be done
  - **Value conflict**: Fundamental differences in beliefs/principles

### Sources in IT Environments
- Resource scarcity (budget, time, personnel)
- Competing priorities and deadlines
- Technical disagreements (architecture, tools, approaches)
- Role ambiguity and unclear responsibilities
- Personality clashes and communication styles
- Cultural differences in distributed teams
- Power struggles and organizational politics

### Conflict Can Be Constructive or Destructive
- **Destructive**: Stress, reduced productivity, damaged relationships, team dysfunction
- **Constructive**: Stimulates innovation, reveals problems early, improves decision-making, strengthens relationships

## 2. Conflict Management Styles (Thomas-Kilmann Model)

Five primary approaches based on **assertiveness** (concern for self) and **cooperativeness** (concern for others):

| Style | Assertiveness | Cooperativeness | When Appropriate | Risk |
|-------|--------------|----------------|------------------|------|
| **Competing** | High | Low | Quick decision needed, protecting vital interests | Damages relationships |
| **Accommodating** | Low | High | Issue more important to others, preserving harmony | May be taken advantage of |
| **Avoiding** | Low | Low | Issue trivial, cooling-off needed | Problems escalate |
| **Collaborating** | High | High | Both concerns important, commitment needed | Time-consuming |
| **Compromising** | Moderate | Moderate | Goals moderately important, equal power | May not fully satisfy either party |

## 3. Conflict Resolution Process

1. **Acknowledge the Conflict**: Recognize it exists, address early
2. **Define the Problem**: Identify root cause, separate facts from assumptions
3. **Gather Information**: Listen actively, ask clarifying questions, find common ground
4. **Generate Options**: Brainstorm solutions, focus on interests not positions
5. **Evaluate and Select Solution**: Assess against criteria, choose best option
6. **Implement and Follow Up**: Put solution into action, monitor progress

---

## 4. Communication Skills for Conflict Management

### Active Listening
- Give full attention, avoid interrupting
- Paraphrase to confirm understanding
- Ask open-ended questions
- Show empathy and validate emotions

### "I" Statements
- Format: "I feel [emotion] when [situation] because [reason]. I need [request]."
- Express feelings without blaming
- Example: "I feel frustrated when deadlines change without notice because it disrupts my planning. I need advance communication about schedule changes."

### Emotional Intelligence Components
- **Self-awareness**: Recognize your own emotions and triggers
- **Self-regulation**: Manage your emotional responses
- **Empathy**: Understand others' emotions and perspectives
- **Social skills**: Navigate social situations effectively

## 5. Negotiation Fundamentals

### What Is Negotiation?
- Dialogue between parties aimed at reaching agreement or resolving differences
- Involves discussion, compromise, and finding mutually acceptable solutions

### Types of Negotiation
- **Distributive (Zero-Sum)**: Fixed pie, one party's gain is another's loss (e.g., salary negotiation)
- **Integrative (Win-Win)**: Expanding the pie, creating value for all parties (e.g., partnership agreements)

### Key Elements
- Parties with different interests
- Issues to be resolved
- Alternatives (BATNA)
- Constraints and deadlines
- Power dynamics

---

## 6. Negotiation Process

1. **Preparation**
   - Define goals and priorities
   - Research other party's interests
   - Determine BATNA (walk-away point)
   - Set target, reservation point, opening offer
   - Anticipate objections

2. **Opening**
   - Establish rapport
   - State position clearly
   - Listen to other party
   - Identify areas of agreement/disagreement

3. **Bargaining**
   - Make concessions strategically
   - Focus on interests, not positions
   - Explore creative options
   - Use objective criteria
   - Manage emotions

4. **Closing**
   - Summarize agreements
   - Confirm understanding
   - Put agreement in writing
   - Ensure commitment

5. **Implementation**
   - Follow through on commitments
   - Monitor progress
   - Maintain relationship

## 7. Negotiation Strategies and Tactics

### Distributive Tactics
- **Anchoring**: Making first offer to set expectations
- **Extreme initial offers**: Starting high/low
- **Reluctant buyer/seller**: Showing hesitation
- **Nibbling**: Asking for small additional concessions at end

### Integrative Tactics
- **Expanding the pie**: Creating more value
- **Logrolling**: Trading off on different priorities
- **Bridging**: Creating new options satisfying both parties
- **Cost-cutting**: Reducing costs for one party without harming the other

### Common Mistakes
- Failing to prepare
- Focusing only on positions
- Getting emotional
- Talking too much, listening too little
- Making premature concessions
- Accepting first offer
- Ignoring BATNA
- Not putting agreements in writing

---

## 8. BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement)

### Definition
Your best option if negotiations fail. Determines your **reservation point** (minimum acceptable outcome).

### Importance
- Gives you power and confidence
- Helps you know when to walk away
- Prevents accepting bad deals
- Guides negotiation strategy

### Example (Job Offer Negotiation)
- Another job offer
- Staying in current position
- Freelancing
- Further education

**Stronger BATNA = More leverage**

---

## 9. Power in Negotiation

### Sources of Power
- **Information**: Relevant data and knowledge
- **Legitimate authority**: Position/role-based power
- **Expertise**: Specialized skills/knowledge
- **Resources**: Control over money, personnel, tools
- **Alternatives**: Strong BATNA
- **Relationships**: Network and connections
- **Commitment**: Willingness to walk away

---

## 10. Cross-Cultural Negotiation

### Challenges
- Different communication styles (direct vs. indirect)
- Varying concepts of time (monochronic vs. polychronic)
- Different relationship-building expectations
- Varying attitudes toward conflict
- Different decision-making processes

### Best Practices
- Research cultural norms and values
- Be patient and show respect
- Build relationships before business
- Use interpreters if needed
- Avoid assumptions based on stereotypes
- Adapt style while staying authentic

## 11. Conflict and Negotiation in IT Teams

### Common Scenarios

1. **Technical Disagreements**
   - Approach: Use data, proof-of-concepts, objective criteria
   - Focus: System requirements, scalability, maintainability

2. **Resource Allocation**
   - Approach: Prioritize based on business value, transparent criteria
   - Focus: Strategic goals, ROI, dependencies

3. **Scope Creep and Deadlines**
   - Approach: Communicate trade-offs, negotiate scope/timeline
   - Focus: Quality, realistic expectations, client relationship

4. **Team Member Conflicts**
   - Approach: Address early, facilitate discussion, focus on work impact
   - Focus: Team goals, professional behavior, mutual respect

5. **Salary and Promotion Negotiations**
   - Approach: Prepare with data on market rates and contributions
   - Focus: Value delivered, market benchmarks, growth potential

## 12. Mediation and Third-Party Intervention

### Mediator Role
- Neutral third party
- Facilitates communication
- Helps parties find solutions
- Does not impose decisions

### When to Use Mediation
- Parties are stuck
- Emotions are high
- Power imbalance exists
- Relationship preservation important
- Legal process too costly/slow

### Arbitration vs. Mediation
- **Arbitration**: Third party makes binding decision
- **Mediation**: Third party helps parties reach their own agreement

---

## 13. Ethical Considerations

Human Rights – PPIT Fall 21 (Week 4)
Complete Text Notes (with image descriptions)

================================================================================
1) What Are Human Rights?
================================================================================
- Universal, inalienable rights inherent to all people regardless of nationality, gender, race, religion, or any status.
- Interdependent and indivisible: civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights reinforce one another.
- Apply offline and online; extend to the digital environment (privacy, expression, access).

Core Characteristics
--------------------
- Universality: Everyone, everywhere.
- Inalienability: Cannot be taken away (only limited under strict, lawful conditions).
- Equality and non-discrimination: Same rights and equal protection for all.
- Accountability and rule of law: States (and increasingly companies) must respect, protect, and fulfill rights.

================================================================================
2) Key Instruments and Frameworks
================================================================================

Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR, 1948)
---------------------------------------------------
- Foundational, non-binding declaration shaping modern human rights law.
- Examples:
  - Article 1: All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.
  - Article 2: Rights without distinction (race, sex, language, religion, etc.).
  - Article 3: Right to life, liberty, security of person.
  - Article 12: Privacy and protection from arbitrary interference.
  - Article 19: Freedom of opinion and expression.
  - Article 23: Right to work; just and favorable conditions.
  - Article 25: Adequate standard of living, health and well-being.

International Covenants (legally binding)
-----------------------------------------
- ICCPR (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights)
  - Life, liberty, fair trial, privacy, expression, association, religion.
- ICESCR (International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights)
  - Work, health, education, adequate standard of living, social security.

Regional Systems (examples)
---------------------------
- ECHR (Europe), ACHR (Americas), ACHPR (Africa).
- Provide courts/commissions for regional enforcement.

Pakistan Context (illustrative touchpoints)
-------------------------------------------
- Constitution of Pakistan:
  - Article 8–28: Fundamental rights (equality, speech, religion, fair trial, privacy of home correspondence, etc.).
  - Article 25: Equality before law; non-discrimination on basis of sex.
  - Article 19: Freedom of speech (reasonable restrictions).
  - Article 19A: Right to information (public importance).
- Domestic legislation intersecting rights:
  - PECA 2016 (cybercrime; must be balanced with speech/privacy).
  - Data protection (draft/sectoral) and privacy jurisprudence.

================================================================================
3) Generations / Categories of Rights
================================================================================
- First generation: Civil and political (life, liberty, fair trial, expression, privacy).
- Second generation: Economic, social, cultural (work, education, health, housing).
- Third generation: Collective/solidarity (development, environment, self-determination, access to resources).

================================================================================
4) Duties and Duty-Bearers
================================================================================
- State duties: Respect (do no harm), Protect (prevent third-party abuses), Fulfill (enable/enforce rights).
- Corporate responsibility (UNGPs on Business and Human Rights): 
  - Respect human rights; conduct due diligence; provide or enable remedy.
- Individual and professional responsibilities: Avoid complicity; uphold professional codes that reflect rights (e.g., privacy by design).

================================================================================
5) Digital and Technology-Related Rights
================================================================================

Privacy and Data Protection
---------------------------
- Article 12 UDHR; Article 17 ICCPR; constitutional privacy of home/correspondence.
- Data minimization, informed consent, purpose limitation, security, retention limits.
- Risks: surveillance, data breaches, secondary use, re-identification.

Freedom of Expression and Information
-------------------------------------
- Article 19 UDHR/ICCPR; Article 19/19A Constitution of Pakistan (with reasonable restrictions).
- Online expression, platform governance, misinformation vs. censorship, proportionality tests.

Non-Discrimination and Equality
-------------------------------
- Algorithmic bias, automated decision-making (employment, credit, policing).
- Need for fairness, transparency, explainability; bias audits and diverse datasets.

Due Process and Fair Trial (Digital)
------------------------------------
- Notice, opportunity to contest automated decisions; transparency of criteria.

Safety and Security
-------------------
- Cybersecurity as enabler of rights; protection from harassment, stalking, threats.

Access and Inclusion
--------------------
- Bridging digital divide; accessibility (WCAG), affordability, language localization.

================================================================================
6) Restrictions and Limitations
================================================================================
- Must be lawful, necessary, proportionate, and for a legitimate aim (e.g., national security, public order, rights of others).
- No arbitrary or overly broad restrictions; require due process and oversight.

================================================================================
7) Business and Human Rights (Tech Focus)
================================================================================
- UN Guiding Principles (UNGPs): Protect–Respect–Remedy.
- Due diligence: identify, prevent, mitigate, and account for impacts.
- Areas: content moderation, surveillance tech, ad targeting, AI/ML bias, supply chain labor.
- Remedy: grievance mechanisms, user redress, transparency reports.

[Image: Loop diagram: Due Diligence → Mitigation → Monitoring → Remedy → Transparency.]

================================================================================
8) Case Illustrations (concise)
================================================================================
- Biased AI hiring tool: Discrimination → violates equality/non-discrimination, due process.
- Mass surveillance program: Privacy intrusion without necessity/proportionality.
- Data breach exposing health data: Violates privacy, security; need for notification and remedy.
- Content takedown without appeal: Expression and due process concerns.
- Accessibility failures: Exclusion of persons with disabilities → equality/inclusion issues.

================================================================================
9) Practical Checklists
================================================================================

Human Rights Impact (for tech projects)
---------------------------------------
- Purpose: What problem? Legitimate aim?
- Necessity & proportionality: Least intrusive means?
- Rights affected: Privacy, expression, equality, due process, safety.
- Stakeholders: Who is impacted, directly and indirectly?
- Data: Minimization, consent, retention, secondary use?
- Bias/Fairness: Testing, audits, explainability.
- Security: Controls, breach response.
- Governance: Policies, oversight, accountability, appeals.
- Transparency: User notices, documentation, public reporting.

Redress and Oversight
---------------------
- Clear channels for complaints/appeals.
- Independent review or audit.
- Documented SLAs for response/remedy.

================================================================================
10) Exam-Oriented Highlights (mapped to study guide)
================================================================================
- Ethical Decision-Making (Q2 – 25 marks): Use 4-Step model; apply to human-rights scenarios (privacy, discrimination, expression). Analyze via Consequentialism, Rights/Duties, Deontology. List stakeholders and give actionable implementation steps.
- Law vs. Ethics (Q1 MCQs): Moral principles ≠ law; restrictions must be lawful, necessary, proportionate.
- Rights and Duties: State duty to respect/protect/fulfill; corporate responsibility to respect (UNGPs).
- Privacy & Data: Minimization, consent, purpose limitation, security, retention; risk of secondary use and re-identification.
- Expression & Information: Article 19/19A; reasonable restrictions; due process for takedowns/appeals.
- Non-Discrimination: Algorithmic bias; need for fairness and equal treatment.
- Jurisdiction/Access: Right to information; bridging digital divide; accessibility obligations.
- Key definitions to memorize: UDHR, ICCPR/ICESCR, necessity/proportionality, universality/inalienability/equality.

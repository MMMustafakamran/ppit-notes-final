## Human Rights (Week 4) — Summary & Exam Hints

> Exam alignment: Use this with `PPIT Final Exam - Study Guide.md`. Human-rights content ties directly into Q2 (4-step ethical decision making) and MCQs on law/ethics/privacy/non-discrimination.

### Core Concepts
- **Definition**: Universal, inalienable rights for all; interdependent (civil, political, economic, social, cultural).
- **Principles**: Universality, inalienability, equality/non-discrimination, accountability, rule of law.
- **Applies online/offline**: Privacy, expression, access, fairness in digital systems.

### Key Instruments
- **UDHR (1948)**: Art.1 (dignity/equality), Art.2 (non-discrimination), Art.3 (life/liberty), Art.12 (privacy), Art.19 (expression), Art.23/25 (work, adequate living).
- **ICCPR / ICESCR**: Civil-political vs. economic-social-cultural rights.
- **Pakistan context** (illustrative): Constitution Arts. 8–28 (fundamental rights), Art.19 (speech w/ restrictions), Art.19A (right to information), Art.25 (equality). Other intersections: PECA 2016, privacy jurisprudence.

### Categories (“Generations”) of Rights
- 1st: Civil & political (life, liberty, fair trial, expression, privacy).
- 2nd: Economic, social, cultural (work, education, health, housing).
- 3rd: Collective/solidarity (development, environment, self-determination).

### Duties & Duty-Bearers
- **State**: Respect, Protect, Fulfill.
- **Corporate (UNGPs)**: Respect rights, human-rights due diligence, enable remedy.
- **Professionals**: Avoid complicity; uphold privacy/fairness/security.

### Tech/Digital Rights Focus
- **Privacy & Data**: Minimization, consent, purpose limitation, security, retention limits; risks—surveillance, breaches, secondary use, re-ID.
- **Expression & Information**: Art.19/19A; ensure due process for takedown/appeal; proportional restrictions.
- **Non-discrimination**: Algorithmic bias → need fairness, explainability, bias audits.
- **Due process**: Notice and ability to contest automated decisions.
- **Access & Inclusion**: Digital divide, affordability, accessibility (WCAG), localization.
- **Safety/Security**: Cybersecurity as an enabler of rights; protection from harassment/stalking.

### Limitations on Rights
- Must be **lawful, necessary, proportionate, for a legitimate aim** (e.g., security, public order, rights of others). No arbitrary/broad restrictions.

### Business & Human Rights (Tech)
- **UNGPs**: Protect–Respect–Remedy; due diligence; grievance mechanisms.
- Areas: content moderation, surveillance tech, ad targeting, AI/ML bias, supply chain labor, transparency reports.

### Practical Checklist (apply in Q2 4-step answers)
- Purpose/legitimate aim? Necessity/proportionality?
- Stakeholders: users, vulnerable groups, employees, regulators, society.
- Rights impacted: privacy, expression, equality, due process, safety.
- Data: minimization, consent, retention, secondary use, security.
- Bias/fairness: tests/audits, diverse data, explainability, appeals.
- Governance: policy, oversight, transparency, redress mechanisms.

### Case Hooks (for framing dilemmas)
- Biased AI hiring → equality/non-discrimination, due process, privacy.
- Mass surveillance → privacy vs. security; necessity/proportionality.
- Data breach → privacy/security; duty to notify/remedy.
- Content takedown w/o appeal → expression + due process.
- Accessibility failures → equality/inclusion.

### Exam Hints (tie to Study Guide)
- **Q2 (25 marks)**: Use 4-Step model; analyze with Consequentialism + Rights/Duties + Deontology. List facts, stakeholders, ethical issues, and give concrete implementation steps and preventive measures.
- **MCQs (law/ethics)**: Moral principles ≠ law; restrictions must be lawful/necessary/proportionate; privacy and non-discrimination are core.
- **Key defs to memorize**: UDHR/ICCPR/ICESCR, universality/inalienability/equality, necessity/proportionality, non-discrimination, due process, privacy principles (minimization/consent/purpose/retention/security).
- **Common pitfalls**: Vague steps, missing stakeholders, ignoring appeals/redress, skipping bias/fairness checks, not addressing proportionality.

### Quick Reference (rights in play for typical IT scenarios)
- **Privacy**: Data collection, monitoring, logs, retention, sharing.
- **Expression/Info**: Takedowns, filtering, moderation, transparency.
- **Equality**: AI bias, accessibility, targeting/exclusion.
- **Due Process**: Notice + appeal for automated decisions/moderation.
- **Security/Safety**: Breach prevention, anti-harassment/stalking controls.
- **Access**: Digital divide, affordability, localization, disability access.

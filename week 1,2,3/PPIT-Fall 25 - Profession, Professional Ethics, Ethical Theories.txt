1) The Computing Profession (Week 1)
================================================================================

What is a Profession?
---------------------
- No single definition; depends on user and context.
- Typical characteristics:
  - Expert knowledge and specialized technical skills.
  - Substantial education and training.
  - Autonomy: independence in practice; members define training/entry.
  - One or more professional bodies.
  - Codes of conduct; internal governance by practitioners.
  - Service to society.

Is Computing a Profession?
--------------------------
- Examine against key traits: Expert knowledge, Autonomy, Internal governance, Service to society.

Attributes of a Mature / Fully Developed Profession
---------------------------------------------------
- Initial professional education and accreditation.
- Skills development; certification; licensing.
- Continuing professional development.
- Code of ethics; professional society.

Professional Organizations / Bodies
-----------------------------------
- Purposes: networking; conferences; journals; standards; career services; codes; membership criteria; advising government; safeguarding public interest; reservation of title/functions.
- Examples: ACM, IEEE-CS, AAAI, AWC, CRA, IEEE, IET.

Origins and Evolution of Professions
------------------------------------
- Driven by revolutions: Agrarian → Industrial → ICT/Knowledge Economy/AI/Data.
- New roles emerging (recent jobs): app developer, data scientist, cloud architect, telemedicine physician, virtual assistant, content moderator, driverless car engineer, etc.

Professional Requirements
-------------------------
- Highly developed skills + deep knowledge; experience-backed.
- Decisions require analysis and adaptation to context.
- Autonomy and power balance: professional vs. client.
- Observance of codes:
  - Professional code (discipline/inspiration/education; protects profession/public).
  - Personal code (cultural/moral).
  - Institutional code (organizational).
  - Community code (cultural/religious; may be backed by civil law).

Pillars of Professionalism
--------------------------
- Commitment: willing, clear, public, realistic; renegotiate if at risk.
- Integrity: honesty, incorruptibility, vision, initiative, love of work, honoring commitments.
- Responsibility: roles, tasks, actions, consequences (product, service, consequential responsibilities).
- Accountability: answerability with goals, plans, reporting, evaluation, incentives/penalties.

2) Professional Ethics (Week 2)
================================================================================

Human vs. Other Creation (faculties)
------------------------------------
- Moral sense (right/wrong), logical reasoning, aesthetic appreciation.

Sources of Knowledge
--------------------
- Observation/experiment; logic/reasoning; established history; (for believers) revelation.

Knowledge vs. Goodness (Paul Tillich)
--------------------------------------
- “Goodness without Knowledge is weak. Knowledge without Goodness is dangerous.”

Values
------
- Motives behind purposeful action; personal/cultural; may or may not be moral.

Ethics Basics
-------------
- Ethics: moral principles/values; study of right/wrong conduct (character).
- Professional ethics: personal + corporate standards expected of professionals.
- Key ethical principles: beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, veracity, fidelity, justice, privacy, tolerance, confidentiality, duty, gratitude, etc.
- Knowing right is not enough—must act.

Why People Act Unethically
--------------------------
- Personal standards differ from society; selfish choices; rationalization; lack of remorse.

Ethics vs. Feelings / Religion / Law
------------------------------------
- Feelings can deviate from ethics; ethics not confined to religion; law ≠ ethics (can diverge).

Computing Ten Commandments (CEI, 1992)
--------------------------------------
1. Do not use a computer to harm others.
2. Do not interfere with others’ computer work.
3. Do not snoop in others’ files.
4. Do not use a computer to steal.
5. Do not use a computer to bear false witness.
6. Do not copy or use software without paying.
7. Do not use others’ computing resources without authorization/compensation.
8. Do not appropriate others’ intellectual output.
9. Think about social consequences of programs/systems.
10. Use computers with consideration and respect.

Codes of Ethics for Computer Professionals (themes)
---------------------------------------------------
- Public good/human rights/diversity; honesty; authorized use of client/employer property; quality, reasonable cost/schedule; privacy/IP respect; disclose conflicts; address errors; lifelong learning; honor agreements.

Ethical Scenarios (discussion prompts)
--------------------------------------
- Illegal software use (“evaluation” for 12 months).
- Vaporware announcements to block competitors.
- Whistleblower vs. loyalty (NASA bug).
- Trade secrets leakage when switching employers.
- Security flaw before delivery; pressured to ship.
- Rounding up performance (dirty bomb model 74.6%→75%).
- Reusing proprietary libraries after job change.

Ethical Decision Factors
------------------------
- Who is affected; rights; risks; benefits; possible actions; responsibilities; acceptable choices.

================================================================================
3) Ethical Theories (Week 3)
================================================================================

Core Theories / Frameworks
--------------------------
- Utilitarianism (consequentialism): greatest good for greatest number; weigh benefits/harms.
- Deontology (Kant): duty/rules; categorical imperative; universalizability; respect persons as ends.
- Rights and Duties: individual rights and corresponding duties; prioritize fundamental rights.
- Egoism: self-interest–based.
- Hedonism: pursuit of happiness/pleasure as highest aim.
- Justice/Fairness: equitable treatment; distributive/procedural.
- Virtue Ethics: character, virtues (honesty, courage, integrity).
- Relativism vs. Moral objectivism: context vs. universal standards.
- Professional codes: applied ethics for professions (ACM/IEEE).

Common IT Ethics Models/Tools
-----------------------------
- 4-Step Decision Process (recognize facts/issues → define dilemma → analyze alternatives → decide & implement).
- Consequentialism, Rights/Duties, Deontology lenses in analysis.
- Quick tests (secrecy, mom, TV, market, smell).
- Golden Rule test.

================================================================================
4) Exam-Oriented Highlights (mapped to PPIT Final Exam - Study Guide)
================================================================================

High-Priority (Q1 MCQs & Q2 Essay)
----------------------------------
- Definitions: profession traits; pillars of professionalism; codes (discipline/inspiration/education, not enforcement).
- Ethical theories: Utilitarianism, Deontology, Egoism, Hedonism, Consequentialism, Rights/Duties.
- 4-Step Ethical Decision Making (Q2 = 25 marks): facts → dilemma → analyze (all three frameworks) → decision + implementation + stakeholders + prevention.
- Whistleblowing: unauthorized disclosure about harmful situations; ethics vs. loyalty.
- Law vs. Ethics: moral principles ≠ law; feelings ≠ ethics.
- Professional bodies: roles/functions; examples (ACM/IEEE); codes of conduct purposes.
- Professional requirements: education, accreditation, certification, licensing, CPD, autonomy, service to society.
- Pillars: commitment, integrity, responsibility, accountability (definitions & maxims).

Common Pitfalls (exam)
----------------------
- Vague implementation steps; missing stakeholders/facts.
- Skipping one of the three frameworks in Q2.
- Confusing business model vs. revenue model vs. value proposition (from study guide).
- Ignoring proportionality/necessity when discussing restrictions (tie-in to rights/privacy).

Quick Recall (for MCQs)
-----------------------
- Veil of incorporation: separates company from owners; limited liability (later weeks).
- Code objectives: discipline, inspiration, education (not enforcement).
- Whistleblower definition; ethical vs. legal.
- Non-compete vs. non-solicitation (later weeks).

Q2 Answer Skeleton (reuse for any scenario)
-------------------------------------------
1) Facts (10–15); Ethical issues (4–6, why/harm); Stakeholders (8–10).
2) Dilemma: “Should X do A or B?” (efficiency vs. fairness, loyalty vs. truth, etc.).
3) Analysis:
   - Consequentialism (A–G): harms/benefits both alternatives → greatest good.
   - Rights/Duties (1–5): whose rights/duties take precedence (fairness, safety, privacy).
   - Deontology (H–P): respect, equal treatment, universalization.
4) Decision + Implementation (5–8 concrete steps), Stakeholder impacts, Preventive measures (tech/org/legal/culture), Pivot-point prevention.

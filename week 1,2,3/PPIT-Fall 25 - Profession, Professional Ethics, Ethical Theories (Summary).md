## Weeks 1–3 Summary: Profession, Professional Ethics, Ethical Theories

> Exam alignment (from PPIT Final Exam – Study Guide):  
> - Q1 MCQs: ethics, codes, profession traits, whistleblowing, law vs. ethics.  
> - Q2 (25 marks): 4-step ethical decision-making with Consequentialism + Rights/Duties + Deontology.  

### 1) Profession & Professionalism
- **Traits**: expert knowledge, substantial education/training, autonomy, internal governance, service to society, codes of conduct, professional bodies.
- **Mature profession**: education + accreditation + certification + licensing + CPD + codes + societies.
- **Bodies**: ACM, IEEE-CS, AAAI, AWC, CRA, IEEE, IET (codes, standards, conferences, careers, advising government).
- **Pillars of Professionalism**: Commitment, Integrity, Responsibility, Accountability.
- **Codes layers**: Professional, Personal, Institutional, Community.
- **Jobs emerging from ICT revolution**: app dev, data scientist, cloud architect, content moderator, driverless car engineer, etc.

### 2) Professional Ethics (Week 2)
- **Ethics**: moral principles/values; right/wrong conduct. Law ≠ ethics; feelings ≠ ethics.
- **Principles**: beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, veracity, fidelity, justice, privacy, confidentiality, duty, tolerance.
- **Why unethical acts?** Differing standards; selfishness; rationalization.
- **Computing Ten Commandments** (CEI 1992): no harm, no theft, no snooping, pay for software, respect IP, think social consequences, use computers respectfully.
- **Codes for CS pros**: public good, honesty, authorized use, quality, privacy/IP respect, disclose conflicts, fix errors, lifelong learning, honor agreements.
- **Scenarios**: illegal SW use, vaporware, whistleblowing vs. loyalty, trade secrets, ship-with-known-bug, rounding up performance, reusing old employer’s libraries.

### 3) Ethical Theories (Week 3)
- **Utilitarianism/Consequentialism**: greatest good for greatest number; weigh harms/benefits.
- **Deontology (Kant)**: duty/rules; categorical imperative; universalizability; respect persons as ends.
- **Rights & Duties**: fundamental rights + corresponding duties; fairness over efficiency when in conflict.
- **Egoism**: self-interest based. **Hedonism**: pursue happiness/pleasure.
- **Justice/Fairness**; **Virtue ethics** (character/virtues).
- **Applied tests**: Golden Rule; quick tests—secrecy, mom, TV, market, smell.

### 4) 4-Step Ethical Decision-Making (Q2 backbone – 25 marks)
1) **Understanding**: list 10–15 facts; 4–6 ethical issues (why/harm); 8–10 stakeholders.
2) **Dilemma**: “Should X do A or B?” (e.g., ship vs. delay; disclose vs. hide; loyalty vs. truth).
3) **Analysis** (both alternatives):
   - **Consequentialism (A–G)**: harms/benefits, short vs. long term → greatest good.
   - **Rights/Duties (1–5)**: whose rights/duties prevail (fairness, safety, privacy).
   - **Deontology (H–P)**: respect, equal treatment, universalization test.
4) **Decision & Implementation**: clear choice; 5–8 concrete steps; stakeholder impacts; 4–6 preventive measures (tech/org/legal/culture); pivot-point prevention.

### 5) Exam Hints & Quick Recall
- **Code objectives**: Discipline, Inspiration, Education (NOT enforcement).
- **Whistleblower**: unauthorized disclosure about harmful situations; ethics vs. loyalty.
- **Law vs. Ethics**: moral principles ≠ law; feelings ≠ ethics.
- **Professional requirements**: education, accreditation, certification, licensing, CPD, autonomy, service to society.
- **Pillars definitions**:  
  - Commitment (clear, public, realistic; renegotiate early)  
  - Integrity (honesty, incorruptibility, vision, initiative, honoring commitments)  
  - Responsibility (roles/tasks/consequences: product/service/consequential)  
  - Accountability (goals → plan → report → evaluate → improve; measures/standards/incentives)
- **Common pitfalls in Q2**: skipping a framework; vague steps; missing stakeholders/facts; no proportionality/necessity when discussing restrictions; not stating pivot-point prevention.

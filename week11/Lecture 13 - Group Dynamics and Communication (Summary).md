# Lecture 13 – Group Dynamics and Communication (Summary)

## 1. Groups Fundamentals

### What Are Groups?
- **Definition**: Collection of two or more individuals who interact, share common goals, and perceive themselves as a unit

### Types of Groups

**Formal Groups** (Created by organization):
- **Command Groups**: Based on organizational hierarchy (e.g., development team)
- **Task Groups**: Formed to accomplish specific tasks (e.g., project team)
- **Cross-Functional Teams**: Members from different departments

**Informal Groups** (Form naturally):
- **Interest Groups**: People with common interests (e.g., coding club)
- **Friendship Groups**: Formed based on personal relationships
- **Reference Groups**: Groups we compare ourselves to

### Group Characteristics
- **Size**: Affects interaction, communication, decision-making
- **Composition**: Diversity in skills, backgrounds, perspectives
- **Structure**: Roles, norms, status hierarchy
- **Cohesiveness**: Degree of attraction members feel toward group
- **Goals**: Shared objectives that unite members

## 2. Group Formation and Development

### Tuckman's Five-Stage Model

| Stage | Characteristics | Key Activities |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| **Forming** | High dependence, low trust, unclear roles | Getting to know each other, uncertainty |
| **Storming** | Conflict, tension, power struggles | Competing for roles, disagreements |
| **Norming** | Cooperation, trust building, role clarity | Establishing norms, accepting structure |
| **Performing** | High performance, synergy, goal achievement | Effective functioning, productivity |
| **Adjourning** | Reflection, transition | Disbanding, moving to new groups |

**Key Insight**: Groups don't form instantly; they progress through predictable stages.

## 3. Group Structure

### Elements of Group Structure

1. **Roles**:
   - **Task Roles**: Help accomplish goals (initiator, coordinator, information seeker)
   - **Maintenance Roles**: Support relationships (encourager, harmonizer, compromiser)
   - **Individual Roles**: Self-centered behaviors (dominator, blocker, recognition seeker)

2. **Norms**:
   - Shared expectations about behavior
   - **Explicit**: Written rules (e.g., code review standards)
   - **Implicit**: Unspoken expectations (e.g., meeting punctuality)
   - Functions: Guide behavior, maintain order, express values

3. **Status**:
   - Relative position or rank in group
   - **Formal**: Job title, organizational position
   - **Informal**: Expertise, charisma, influence
   - Affects: Influence, participation, decision-making

4. **Cohesiveness**:
   - Forces keeping members in group
   - **High**: Strong loyalty, high participation, better performance (if goals align)
   - **Low**: Weak bonds, less commitment, potential turnover
   - Factors: Similarity, shared goals, external threats, success, small size

5. **Size**:
   - **Small (2-7)**: More interaction, faster decisions, limited resources
   - **Medium (8-15)**: Balance of interaction and resources
   - **Large (16+)**: More resources, less interaction, potential subgroups

## 4. Group Decision-Making

### Advantages
- More information and knowledge
- Diverse perspectives and alternatives
- Better understanding and acceptance
- Legitimacy and validity
- Synergy through collaboration

### Disadvantages
- Time-consuming (slower than individual)
- **Groupthink**: Pressure for conformity
- Dominance by strong personalities
- Ambiguous responsibility
- **Social loafing**: Some contribute less

### Decision-Making Techniques

| Technique | Process | Best For | Benefits |
|-----------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Brainstorming** | Generate ideas without criticism | Creative solutions | Participation, innovation |
| **Nominal Group** | Silent generation → sharing → discussion → voting | Structured input needed | Prevents dominance, all voices heard |
| **Delphi** | Anonymous expert input → summary → feedback → iteration | Expert knowledge, dispersed | Avoids pressure, expert input |
| **Consensus** | All agree to support decision | High commitment needed | High buy-in, shared ownership |
| **Majority Vote** | Decision by majority rule | Fast decision needed | Quick, clear outcome |
| **Authority** | Leader makes decision | Urgent, clear accountability needed | Fastest, clear responsibility |

---

## 5. Groupthink

### Symptoms
- Illusion of invulnerability (overconfidence)
- Collective rationalization (dismissing warnings)
- Belief in inherent morality
- Stereotyped views of out-groups
- Direct pressure on dissenters
- Self-censorship
- Illusion of unanimity
- Mindguards (protecting from dissent)

### Prevention Strategies
- Encourage critical evaluation and devil's advocate
- Leader avoids stating preferences early
- Invite outside experts
- Create independent subgroups
- Hold second-chance meetings
- Encourage diverse perspectives

## 6. Communication Fundamentals

### Communication Process Model
1. **Sender**: Initiates communication
2. **Encoding**: Converting thoughts into messages
3. **Message**: Information being communicated
4. **Channel**: Medium (verbal, written, digital, nonverbal)
5. **Decoding**: Receiver interprets message
6. **Receiver**: Receives message
7. **Feedback**: Response indicating understanding
8. **Noise**: Interference (physical, psychological, semantic)

### Types of Communication

| Type | Description | Advantages | Limitations |
|------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| **Verbal** | Spoken or written words | Precise, documented, clear | Language barriers, misinterpretation |
| **Nonverbal** | Body language, tone, gestures | Conveys emotions, reinforces | Ambiguous, cultural variations |
| **Written** | Documents, emails, reports | Permanent, reviewable | No immediate feedback, time-consuming |
| **Digital** | Video calls, messaging, tools | Fast, convenient, remote | Lacks context, tech issues |

**Key Insight**: Nonverbal cues often more powerful than words.

## 7. Communication Channels

### Channel Richness (Information-Carrying Capacity)

**Rich Channels** (High Information):
- **Face-to-face**: Highest richness, immediate feedback, nonverbal cues
- **Video conferencing**: High richness, visual and audio cues
- **Telephone**: Moderate-high, tone of voice, immediate feedback

**Moderate Channels**:
- **Email**: Moderate, attachments, delayed feedback
- **Instant messaging**: Moderate, quick but limited cues
- **Written documents**: Moderate-low, permanent but no immediate feedback

**Lean Channels** (Low Information):
- **Bulletins, memos**: Low richness, one-way, no feedback
- **Formal reports**: Low richness, structured, limited interaction

### Channel Selection Guidelines
- **Use Rich Channels For**: Complex messages, ambiguous situations, emotional content, immediate feedback needed
- **Use Lean Channels For**: Simple messages, routine information, documentation needed, reaching many people

## 8. Communication Networks

### Types of Networks

| Network | Structure | Characteristics | Best For |
|--------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Chain** | Linear: A→B→C→D→E | Sequential, slow, high accuracy | Assembly lines, hierarchical |
| **Wheel** | Central hub, all through center | Fast, centralized, leader satisfaction | Strong leader, crisis |
| **All-Channel** | Everyone with everyone | Fast, high satisfaction, complex tasks | Problem-solving, creative |
| **Circle** | Adjacent members only | Moderate speed, moderate satisfaction | Some committees |
| **Y** | Combination chain/wheel | Moderate speed, some centralization | Some org structures |

## 9. Barriers to Effective Communication

| Barrier Type | Examples | Solutions |
|--------------|----------|-----------|
| **Physical** | Distance, noise, poor technology, time zones | Better technology, quiet spaces, scheduling |
| **Psychological** | Perceptions, emotions, attitudes, stress | Self-awareness, emotional intelligence |
| **Language/Semantic** | Jargon, technical terms, ambiguity | Clear language, define terms |
| **Cultural** | Different values, norms, styles | Cultural awareness, sensitivity |
| **Organizational** | Hierarchy, status, information overload | Flatten structures, multiple channels |
| **Personal** | Poor listening, defensiveness, biases | Active listening training, open-mindedness |

- Misinterpretation (higher risk without context)

### Best Practices
1. Use appropriate tools (match tool to task)
2. Establish communication norms (response times, protocols)
3. Over-communicate (provide more context)
4. Use video when possible (visual cues build relationships)
5. Document important decisions (written records)
6. Schedule regular check-ins (maintain connection)
7. Create virtual water cooler moments (informal interactions)
8. Be mindful of time zones (rotate meetings, async communication)
9. Set clear expectations (deadlines, availability)
10. Build trust (consistent communication, follow through)

## 12. Communication Styles

| Style | Characteristics | Impact |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| **Assertive** | Direct, honest, respectful, confident | Clear communication, mutual respect |
| **Aggressive** | Hostile, demanding, blaming, disrespectful | Creates conflict, damages relationships |
| **Passive** | Submissive, indirect, avoids conflict | Needs unmet, resentment builds |
| **Passive-Aggressive** | Sarcastic, indirect resistance | Creates confusion, undermines trust |

**Best Practice**: Assertive style promotes effective communication and problem-solving.

## 13. Conflict in Groups

### Types of Conflict

| Type | Description | Impact | Example |
|------|-------------|--------|---------|
| **Task Conflict** | Disagreement about work content/goals/methods | Can be constructive | Which technology to use |
| **Relationship Conflict** | Personal incompatibilities, personality clashes | Usually destructive | Personal animosity |
| **Process Conflict** | Disagreement about how work should be done | Can be constructive or destructive | Project management approach |

### Conflict Resolution Strategies

| Strategy | Approach | When to Use | Benefits |
|----------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Collaboration** | Work together for win-win solution | Important issue, need commitment, time available | Best solution, high commitment |
| **Compromise** | Each gives up something | Moderate importance, equal power, time pressure | Fair solution, maintains relationships |
| **Accommodation** | Yield to other's concerns | Issue less important, relationship matters | Maintains harmony |
| **Competition** | Assert position, try to win | Quick decision, critical issue, unpopular action | Fast resolution |
| **Avoidance** | Withdraw or ignore | Issue trivial, no chance of winning, cooling off | Prevents escalation |

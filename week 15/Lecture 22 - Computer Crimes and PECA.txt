Footprinting & Reconnaissance
-----------------------------

What Is Footprinting?
---------------------
Footprinting is gathering detailed information about a target’s:
- Systems.
- People.
- Networks.
- Software.
- Online footprint.
- Vulnerabilities.

This is also known as **OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)**.

What Attackers Look For
-----------------------
- Domain names, subdomains, DNS records.
- IP ranges and server locations.
- Tech stack (frameworks, CMS, cloud provider).
- Leaked credentials from data breaches.
- Visible software versions with known exploits.
- Employee details (LinkedIn, GitHub, social media).
- Emails, PDFs, invoices with metadata.
- Public GitHub repos with API keys or passwords.
- Company news, RFPs, job ads revealing the stack.

Footprinting (Reconnaissance) – Definition
------------------------------------------
Footprinting is the first step of most attacks: the attacker collects information about a target system to identify possible ways to intrude.

Types of Footprinting
---------------------
- **Passive Footprinting**:
  - Gathering info about the target without direct interaction (e.g., search engines, public records).
- **Active Footprinting**:
  - Gathering info by directly interacting with target systems (e.g., port scans).

Information Obtained in Footprinting
------------------------------------
- **Network Information**:
  - Domains, subdomains, subnets, IP details of servers/devices, Whois data, DNS records, etc.
- **Organization Information**:
  - Employee details, phone numbers, locations, background, used web technologies.
- **System Information**:
  - OS of web servers, locations, user accounts, passwords if leaked or exposed.

Objectives of Footprinting
--------------------------
- Understand security posture.
- Reduce focus area (identify high‑value targets).
- Identify vulnerabilities.
- Draw a network map and plan attack paths.


Technical Footprinting: Mapping the Target's Infrastructure
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Domain & Server Discovery
----------------------------
- Use WHOIS and similar tools to:
  - Fetch domain records.
  - Identify email and web server IP addresses.
  - Determine whether servers are self‑hosted or cloud‑hosted.
  - Obtain hosting provider details and physical location (approximate).

2. Netcraft Analysis (netcraft.com)
-----------------------------------
Netcraft can reveal:
- Web server type (Apache, Nginx, IIS).
- Operating system.
- Uptime and time since last reboot.
- Technology stack and software versions.
- Historical snapshots of the site.

3. Port Scanning & Firewall Mapping
-----------------------------------
- Detect open services and exposed ports, for example:
  - Port 110 → POP3 mail server.
  - Ports 137, 138, 139 → Windows NetBIOS services.
  - Web ports: 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), etc.
- Helps identify services, misconfigurations, and firewall gaps.

  - Inject malware into traffic.


Network Sniffing
----------------
- Using tools like Wireshark to capture network traffic.
- On unencrypted channels:
  - Attackers may see usernames, passwords, and raw data.
- Even on encrypted channels:
  - Metadata and patterns can still leak information.


Malware and Ransomware
----------------------
- Viruses:
  - Attach to files and spread when executed.
- Worms:
  - Self‑replicate over networks without user action.
- Trojans:
  - Malicious software disguised as legitimate programs.
- Spyware:

  - Ethnicity.
  - Nationality.
  - Sect or community.
  - Race or cultural identity.
- Online hate speech can trigger real‑world violence, harassment, and social division.

2. Defamation
-------------
- Sharing false statements that harm someone’s reputation.
- Examples:
  - Fake accusations.
  - Edited screenshots.
  - Rumors via WhatsApp or social media.
  - False allegations in posts or videos.
- Why it spreads:
  - Emotional content travels faster.
  - People share without verifying.
  - Anonymous/fake accounts create narratives with no accountability.

3. Fake News & Misinformation
-----------------------------

Jurisdiction & International Issues
-----------------------------------
Cybercrimes often cross borders, making investigation and prosecution complex.

1. Borderless Nature of Cybercrime
----------------------------------
A single attack may involve:
- Victim in one country.
- Criminal in another.
- Servers in a third.
- Payment routed through a fourth.

This makes enforcement complicated.

2. Where Can Someone Be Tried?
------------------------------
Questions:
- Which country’s laws apply?
- Where was the offence “committed”?
- Where is the impact felt?
- Where is the attacker located?

Different countries have different standards for evidence, privacy, and digital searches.

3. Extradition Challenges
-------------------------
If a criminal operates from another country:
- Local authorities cannot directly arrest them.
- Extradition requires formal agreements (treaties).
- Both countries must recognize the act as a crime (dual criminality).
- International cooperation is required for investigations.

Without treaties, legal action can be very difficult.

4. Extraterritorial Claims
--------------------------
- Some countries claim jurisdiction even when:
  - The attacker is outside their borders.
  - The victim is a citizen abroad.

5. Practical Challenges in Real Cases
-------------------------------------
- Servers in multiple countries.
- Platforms not cooperating with foreign law enforcement.
- Anonymous or VPN-masked attackers.
- Cryptocurrency payments that are hard to trace.
- Conflicting privacy laws (e.g., GDPR) affecting investigations.

  - Employee details, phone numbers, locations, background, web technologies, etc.
- System Information:
  - OS and location of web servers, user accounts, passwords, etc.

Objectives of Footprinting
--------------------------
- Knowledge of security posture.
- Reduction of focus area (prioritizing targets).
- Identifying vulnerabilities.
- Drawing a network map.

Technical Footprinting: Mapping the Target's Infrastructure
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Domain & Server Discovery
----------------------------
- Use WHOIS and similar tools to:
  - Fetch domain records.
  - Identify email and web server IP addresses.
  - Determine whether servers are self-hosted or cloud-hosted.
  - Obtain hosting provider and (approximate) physical location.

2. Netcraft Analysis (netcraft.com)
-----------------------------------
Netcraft can reveal:
- Web server type (Apache, Nginx, IIS, etc.).
- Operating system.
- Uptime and time since last reboot.
- Technology stack and software versions.
- Historical snapshots of the site.

3. Port Scanning & Firewall Mapping
-----------------------------------
- Used to detect open services and exposed ports, for example:
  - Port 110 → POP3 mail server.
  - Ports 137, 138, 139 → Windows NetBIOS services.
  - Common web ports like 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), etc.
- Helps identify which services are running and where firewalls might be misconfigured.

[Image: Diagrams and screenshots typically show tools like WHOIS output, Netcraft reports, and port scan results illustrating reconnaissance steps.]

Password Attacks (Overview)
---------------------------
- Brute force attacks: trying many passwords automatically.
- Dictionary attacks: using lists of common passwords.
- Credential stuffing: reusing leaked credentials from previous breaches.
- Social engineering: tricking users into revealing passwords.
- Keyloggers and phishing pages to steal credentials.

Website Attacks (Overview)
--------------------------
- SQL Injection: injecting malicious SQL queries via input fields to read or modify database contents.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): injecting scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
- Session Hijacking: stealing or guessing session tokens to impersonate users.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and other web-based exploits.

Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks
--------------------------------
- Intercepting and altering communication between two parties without their knowledge.
- Can be done on insecure Wi-Fi networks, using rogue access points, or via compromised routers.
- Used to steal login credentials, modify transactions, or inject malware.

Network Sniffing
----------------
- Using tools like Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic.
- On unencrypted channels, attackers can see usernames, passwords, and other sensitive data.
- Even on encrypted channels, metadata and patterns can still leak information.

Malware and Ransomware
----------------------
- Viruses: attach to files and spread when executed.
- Worms: self-replicate over networks without user action.
- Trojans: malicious software disguised as legitimate programs.
- Spyware: secretly monitors user activity.
- Ransomware: encrypts data and demands ransom payment (often in cryptocurrency), sometimes combined with data exfiltration (“double extortion”).

Identity Theft
--------------
- Stealing personal information (CNIC, passports, bank details).
- Using someone else's social media or email accounts.
- SIM swapping to gain control of phone numbers and OTPs.
- Opening fake accounts or misusing digital identity in financial fraud.

Illegal and Harmful Online Content
----------------------------------
- Revenge porn and non-consensual intimate images.
- Child sexual abuse material.
- Hate speech and sectarian or ethnic incitement.
- Extremist propaganda and recruitment material.
- Deepfakes used to defame or blackmail individuals.

Why Illegal Content Is a Major Cybercrime Issue
-----------------------------------------------
- Uploaded content can become effectively permanent online.
- Search engines and social platforms amplify its reach.
- Victims have little control once content leaks.
- AI tools make manipulation (deepfakes, photoshops) easier.
- Even “jokes” or “pranks” can have serious legal and social consequences.

Hate Speech, Defamation & Fake News
-----------------------------------
The internet amplifies harmful content that can damage reputations, divide communities, or create public unrest.

Impacts:
- Damage to reputation.
- Public humiliation.
- Harm to academic, professional, or social standing.
- Misleading political messages.
- Hoaxes designed to create fear or panic.

1. Hate Speech
--------------
Publishing or spreading content that attacks individuals or groups based on:
- Religion.
- Ethnicity.
- Nationality.
- Sect or community.
- Race or cultural identity.

Hate speech online can trigger real-world violence, harassment, or social division.

2. Defamation
-------------
Sharing false statements that harm someone's reputation.

Examples:
- Fake accusations.
- Edited screenshots.
- Rumours spread through WhatsApp or social media.
- False allegations in posts or videos.

Why it spreads:
- Emotional content travels faster.
- People share without verifying.
- Anonymous accounts create fake narratives.

3. Fake News & Misinformation
-----------------------------
- Intentionally or accidentally spreading false information.
- Altered videos or images.
- Fake “breaking news”.
- Wrong information about exams, jobs, admissions, etc.

4. Impact on Society
--------------------
- Panic and confusion.
- Loss of trust in institutions.
- Harm to individuals or communities.
- Social and political instability.
- Destroyed reputations.

Jurisdiction & International Issues
-----------------------------------
Cybercrimes often cross borders, making investigation and prosecution complex.

1. Borderless Nature of Cybercrime
----------------------------------
A single attack may involve:
- Victim in one country.
- Criminal in another.
- Servers in a third.
- Payment routed through a fourth.

This makes enforcement complicated.

2. Where Can Someone Be Tried?
------------------------------
Key questions:
- Which country's laws apply?
- Where was the offence “committed”?
- Where is the impact felt?
- Where is the attacker located?

Different countries have different standards for evidence, privacy, and digital searches.

3. Extradition Challenges
-------------------------
If a criminal flees or operates from another country:
- Local authorities cannot directly arrest them.
- Extradition requires formal agreements (Extradition Treaty).
- Both countries must recognize the act as a crime.
- Investigations require international cooperation.

Without treaties, legal action becomes very difficult.

4. Extraterritorial Claims
--------------------------
Some countries claim jurisdiction even when:
- The attacker is outside their borders.
- The victim is a citizen abroad.

5. Practical Challenges in Real Cases
-------------------------------------
- Servers located in multiple countries.
- Platforms not cooperating with foreign law enforcement.
- Anonymous or VPN-masked attackers.
- Cryptocurrency payments that are hard to trace.
- Different privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) affecting investigations.

What Is PECA? (Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016)

Criticism on PECA
-----------------
- Critics say the bill is too harsh, with punishments that do not fit many crimes.
- The language leaves it open to abuse by law enforcement agencies, security agencies, and the government.
- Recommendations of stakeholders were ignored during formulation.
- It is said to restrict freedom of expression and access to information.
- Offences are numerous and overlap with other existing laws.
- Vague wording leaves many clauses open to interpretation.
- It can be misused to target journalists, their sources, and whistleblowers.
- Criteria for surveillance is very open-ended, even more than the Fair Trial Act 2013.
- Mechanisms for practical implementation and oversight are missing or weak.
- The bill mixes cybercrime with cyberterrorism and cyber warfare issues.
- The designated authority is not independent of the executive and has sweeping powers to block or destroy online material, sometimes without a court order.
- It does not adequately differentiate cyber crime from cyber terrorism and cyber warfare.

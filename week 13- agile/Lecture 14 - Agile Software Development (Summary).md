### Lecture 14 – Agile Software Development (Summary)

#### 1. Why Agile?
- Traditional **waterfall** assumes stable, complete requirements and delivers value late; changes are costly.
- In reality, requirements change, and users only understand needs after seeing working software.
- Agile focuses on **early and continuous delivery**, close collaboration, and fast response to change.

#### 2. Agile Manifesto & Principles
- Values:
  - **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
  - **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
  - **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
  - **Responding to change** over following a plan.
- Core principles:
  - Deliver working software frequently.
  - Welcome changing requirements.
  - Business + devs work together daily.
  - Sustainable pace, simple design, technical excellence.
  - Self‑organizing teams and regular **retrospectives** to improve.

#### 3. Key Agile Practices
- **Iterative + incremental** development in short timeboxes (iterations/sprints).
- **User stories** to capture requirements from a user’s perspective.
- **Product backlog** prioritized by value/risk; refined continuously.
- **Timeboxing** and frequent demos for feedback.
- **Continuous integration & testing**: small, frequent merges + automated tests.
- Strong emphasis on communication (daily stand‑ups, shared boards).

#### 4. Scrum Overview
- Roles:
  - **Product Owner** – owns backlog, prioritizes by value, represents stakeholders.
  - **Scrum Master** – facilitates process, removes impediments.
  - **Development Team** – cross‑functional, self‑organizing, delivers increments.
- Events:
  - **Sprint** (1–4 weeks) → potentially shippable increment.
  - **Sprint Planning**, **Daily Scrum**, **Sprint Review**, **Sprint Retrospective**.
- Artifacts:
  - **Product Backlog**, **Sprint Backlog**, **Increment** (meets Definition of Done).

#### 5. XP (Extreme Programming) Practices
- **TDD** (tests first), **pair programming**, **continuous integration**, **refactoring**, **simple design**, **collective ownership**.
- Aim: high code quality so the team can change the system safely and quickly.

#### 6. Estimation, Velocity & Planning
- Use **relative estimation** (story points) instead of exact hours.
- **Velocity** = story points finished per sprint; used for forecasting.
- Release planning uses backlog priority + velocity; plans are updated as feedback and learning occur.

#### 7. Benefits and Challenges
- Benefits:
  - Faster, incremental value delivery; better alignment with real user needs.
  - Higher transparency and adaptability; continuous improvement.
- Challenges:
  - Cultural change; risk of misinterpreting Agile as “no planning/documentation”.
  - Coordination harder in large or highly regulated environments; needs discipline and good engineering.

> **Exam/Project takeaway:** Agile is about **short feedback loops, collaboration, and adaptability**—not chaos. Understand Scrum roles/events, XP practices, user stories, and how Agile trades heavy upfront planning for continuous planning plus strong engineering discipline.

### Lecture 16 – Business Models in IT (Summary)

#### 1. What Is a Business Model?
- Describes **how an IT product/company creates, delivers, and captures value**:
  - Who the customers are.
  - What problem/value you provide.
  - How you earn revenue.
  - What key resources, activities, and partners you need.

#### 2. Horizontal vs Vertical
- **Horizontal**: generic tools for many industries (office suites, email, generic CRM, cloud infra).
- **Vertical**: tailored for a specific sector (core banking, HIS, airline booking, LMS).
- Many IT firms specialize in one or more **verticals** to gain deep domain knowledge and reusable components.

#### 3. Common Digital Business Models
- **Product license (perpetual)** – one‑time software sale (plus upgrades/maintenance); revenue is lumpy and upgrades are harder.
- **Subscription / SaaS** – recurring monthly/annual fees; predictable revenue, easy updates, lower upfront cost.
- **Freemium** – free basic tier, paid premium features; needs a clear upgrade path to convert users.
- **Advertising‑supported** – free to users, revenue from advertisers; requires large user base and careful privacy/compliance.
- **Marketplace/platform** – connects buyers and sellers; earns via commissions, listing fees, or value‑added services.
- **Usage‑based/transactional** – pay per use (cloud compute, API calls, SMS/email, etc.).
- **Licensing & white‑label** – license technology or provide rebrandable solutions to other businesses.
- **Open source & dual licensing** – free core code + paid support/hosting/commercial license.
- **Data‑driven/analytics** – sell insights or data products; must respect privacy and consent.

#### 4. Business Model Canvas (Key Blocks)
- **Customer Segments** – who you serve (B2C, B2B, B2G, multi‑sided).
- **Value Proposition** – which problem you solve and why you’re better.
- **Channels** – how you reach customers (web, app stores, partners, sales).
- **Customer Relationships** – self‑service, communities, account managers, etc.
- **Revenue Streams** – subscriptions, ads, fees, licenses, services.
- **Key Resources** – team, tech, IP, brand, data.
- **Key Activities** – building, operating, marketing, supporting the product.
- **Key Partners** – cloud providers, payment processors, resellers, integrators.
- **Cost Structure** – salaries, infra, marketing, support, compliance costs.

#### 5. Choosing and Evaluating a Model
- Ask:
  - Who pays and for what value?
  - Does subscription, usage‑based, or transaction‑based pricing fit better?
  - Is freemium realistic (can you support free users and still convert enough to paid)?
  - Do network effects or marketplaces play a role?
- Watch out for:
  - “Free forever” without a revenue path.
  - Over‑reliance on ads without scale.
  - Ignoring acquisition, support, and regulatory costs.
- In regulated verticals (finance, health, telecom, government), models must respect **laws, privacy, and sector‑specific rules**.

> **Exam/Project takeaway:** Be able to name and explain major IT business models (license, SaaS, freemium, ads, marketplace, usage‑based, etc.), sketch a simple **Business Model Canvas** for a tech idea, and recognize how vertical, regulation, and data/privacy constraints influence the revenue model you choose.

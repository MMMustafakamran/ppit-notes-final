### Lecture 15 – IT Industry Verticals (Summary)

#### 1. What Are Industry Verticals?
- **Industry vertical**: a specific sector (e.g., banking, healthcare, telecom) with its own business processes, regulations, and IT needs.
- **Horizontal IT** = generic tools (email, office, generic CRM, infrastructure); **vertical IT** = domain‑specific solutions (core banking, HIS, airline booking).
- Specializing in a vertical gives software firms and professionals deeper value and competitive advantage.

#### 2. Major Verticals and Their IT Needs
- **BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, Insurance)**:
  - Systems: core banking, payment gateways, trading platforms, fraud/AML/KYC.
  - Priorities: high security, uptime, regulatory compliance, auditability.
- **Healthcare & Life Sciences**:
  - Systems: HIS, EHR/EMR, LIS, telemedicine.
  - Priorities: patient privacy (PHI), accuracy, integration with medical devices, standards (HL7/FHIR).
- **Telecom & Networking**:
  - Systems: billing/charging, CRM, network management, provisioning, self‑care apps.
  - Priorities: massive event volumes, real‑time rating, scalability, lawful intercept/data retention.
- **Retail & E‑Commerce**:
  - Systems: POS, inventory, e‑commerce platforms, recommendations, loyalty programs.
  - Priorities: UX, checkout speed, seasonal scaling, integration with payments/logistics.
- **Manufacturing & Supply Chain**:
  - Systems: ERP, MRP, MES, SCADA, supply chain and fleet management.
  - Priorities: real‑time monitoring, optimization of inventory/production, machine integration.
- **Government & Public Sector**:
  - Systems: citizen ID, tax/e‑filing, land records, licensing, e‑governance portals.
  - Priorities: scalability, transparency, security, balancing privacy with Right‑to‑Information.
- **Education & EdTech**:
  - Systems: SIS, LMS, exam/assessment platforms, virtual classrooms.
  - Priorities: secure exams, scalable content, handling student records and grades.
- **Energy, Utilities & Smart Infrastructure**:
  - Systems: smart metering/billing, grid monitoring (SCADA), outage management.
  - Priorities: reliability, real‑time telemetry, cyber‑security of critical infrastructure.
- **Media, Entertainment & Gaming**:
  - Systems: streaming platforms, DRM, recommendation engines, game servers.
  - Priorities: low‑latency delivery, peak‑traffic scaling, IP/copyright management.

#### 3. Cross‑Cutting Concerns Across Verticals
- **Security & compliance**: finance (KYC/AML), healthcare (PHI), telecom (intercept), government (FOI + privacy).
- **Data & analytics**: fraud detection, personalization, operational optimization.
- **Cloud & APIs**: many vertical products delivered as SaaS/microservices with integration APIs.
- **Domain knowledge** is as important as technical skill for roles like BA, architect, PO in a given vertical.

> **Exam/Project takeaway:** Know the **key verticals**, example systems in each (core banking, HIS, LMS, ERP, etc.), and the **main constraints** (regulations, privacy, performance). Combining domain knowledge with IT skills is how companies and individuals become “specialists” in an industry.

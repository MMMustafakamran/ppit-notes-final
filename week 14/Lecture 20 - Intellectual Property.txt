Intellectual Property
=====================

What is Property?
-----------------

1. Tangible Property
--------------------
- Physical objects that can be touched.
- Protected under theft and damage laws.
- Examples: mobile phone, laptop, book.

2. Intangible Property
----------------------
- Cannot be touched.
- Created through human intellect.
- Protected through Intellectual Property (IP) laws.
- Examples: code, formulas, designs, brand names.

Tangible vs Intangible Assets
-----------------------------

Tangible Assets:
- Land.
- Cash.
- Stock.
- Bonds.
- Furniture.
- Inventory.
- Machinery.
- Equipment.

Intangible Assets:
- Trademarks.
- Patents.
- Customer lists.
- Employment contracts.
- Internet domain names.
- Goodwill.
- Brand recognition.
- Copyrights.

Why Intellectual Property is Different
--------------------------------------
- Tangible property, when stolen, is physically taken from you.
- Intangible property can be copied without you losing the original.
- Value lies in the knowledge or expression, not in the physical object.
- Because of this, it is not protected under normal theft laws.
- Instead, specialized IP laws exist to prevent unauthorized use and copying.

Example:
- Someone reads your formula from your desk, memorizes it, and uses it, even though you still have your original copy. This is an IP misuse issue rather than classic theft.

What is Intellectual Property?
------------------------------
Intellectual Property (IP) refers to creations of the human mind, including:
- Software and source code.
- Literary and artistic works.
- Scientific and technical designs.
- Logos, symbols, and brand identities.
- Multimedia content.
- Inventions, formulas, and innovative ideas.

Key idea:
- IP is intangible, created through human intellect, and protected to encourage creativity and prevent unauthorized use.

Why IP Protection Matters in Computing
--------------------------------------
- Software is easy to copy, modify, and redistribute, which creates risk.
- Without IP protection, creators can lose revenue, ownership, and recognition.

IP laws ensure:
- Exclusive rights to your work.
- Ability to license or sell your creation.
- Protection against unauthorized copying or misuse.

IP is essential for:
- Startups and entrepreneurs.
- Software houses and freelancers.
- Researchers and product innovators.

How Software Uses Multiple IP Protections
-----------------------------------------
A single software product can be protected through several IP rights at the same time, each covering a different aspect:

- Copyright:
  - Protects source code, documentation, UI screens.
- Patent:
  - Protects a novel algorithm, method, or technical process.
- Trade Secret:
  - Protects internal architecture, logic, or proprietary processes.
- Trademark:
  - Protects the product name, logo, icon, or brand identity.
- Design Protection:
  - Protects visual design elements such as patterns, shapes, or icons.

Using these together provides comprehensive protection against copying, misuse, and unfair competition.

-------------
Examples of protected works:
- Literary works.
- Music.
- Dramatic works.
- Choreography.
- Art and photos.

Protecting Your Startup Idea
----------------------------
If your Final Year Project or startup introduces a new product, different IP rights can safeguard different parts of it:

- Copyright:
  - Protects your source code, documentation, UI screens, and all written or visual content automatically.
- Patent:
  - Can protect a novel algorithm, process, or technical invention so others cannot replicate it.
- Trade Secret:
  - Protects internal design details, architecture, or proprietary logic from being disclosed.
- Trademark:
  - Protects your product's name, logo, and visual branding to prevent others from using your identity.

Using these protections together strengthens your idea before launching it in the market.

Importance of IP in the Global Economy
--------------------------------------
- Intellectual Property is a key driver of the modern global economy.
- Nations strengthen IP frameworks to attract investment and promote innovation.
- IP influences global trade, technology transfer, and economic growth.
- International treaties create uniform standards across countries.
- As a WTO member, Pakistan must comply with TRIPS and other IP obligations.

Copyrights
----------

Case Example: Authors Guild, Inc. v. Google, Inc.
-------------------------------------------------
- United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.
- 954 F. Supp. 2d 282 (2013).
- (Case often discussed for digital copying and fair use; demonstrates how copyright applies to large-scale digitization.)

What is Copyright?
------------------
- Copyright protects the expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves.
- It applies to any original work that is in a fixed form, including:
  - Software and source code.
  - Documents, reports, books.
  - Images, graphics, artwork.
  - Music, audio recordings.
  - Videos and films.
  - Databases and compilations.

Key idea:
- Once you create an original work and record it in some medium, copyright protection is automatic.

What Does Copyright Protect?
----------------------------

1. Audio-Visual Works
----------------------
- Includes videos, films, and broadcasts.

2. Artistic Works
-----------------
- Covers drawings, graphics, and photographs.

3. Digital Works
----------------
- Covers websites, multimedia content, and e-learning material.

4. Musical and Dramatic Works
-----------------------------
- Compositions, scripts, and choreography.

5. Literary Works
-----------------
- Includes software code, documentation, and databases.

Rights Granted by Copyright
---------------------------
Copyright gives the creator exclusive control over how their work is used. These rights include:

1. Reproduction Right:
   - The right to make copies of the work.

2. Distribution Right:
   - The right to distribute copies to the public.

3. Public Display Right:
   - The right to show the work publicly (images, videos, artwork, code snippets).

4. Public Performance Right:
   - The right to perform audio, video, music, or dramatic works in public.

5. Derivative Works Right:
   - The right to create adaptations, modifications, translations, or new versions of the original work.

Key idea:
- These rights allow creators to control commercial use and prevent unauthorized copying or modification.

Copyright Ownership
-------------------
Ownership depends on who created the work and under what conditions:

1. Individual Creator:
   - The author is the first owner of the work.

2. Employee Works:
   - If created in the course of employment, the employer is the copyright owner (unless the contract says otherwise).

3. Commissioned Work:
   - Ownership depends on the agreement between parties.
   - If no agreement exists, the creator typically owns the copyright.

4. Licensing:
   - Creators can give others the right to use their work through exclusive or non-exclusive licenses.

5. Joint Works:
   - When two or more people contribute significantly, they share ownership.

Key idea:
- Copyright automatically belongs to the creator unless legally transferred.

Duration of Copyright Protection
--------------------------------
Copyright protection lasts for a significant period to ensure creators benefit from their work.

Standard Duration:
- Life of the author + 50 years (under Pakistan Copyright Ordinance 1962).

For Anonymous or Corporate Works:
- 50 years from the date of first publication.

No Renewal Needed:
- Copyright is automatically granted when the work is created.
- No registration is required for protection (although registration strengthens enforcement).

After Expiry:
- The work enters the public domain.
- Anyone may use it freely without permission.

Copyright Infringement: What Counts as Copying?
-----------------------------------------------
A person infringes copyright when they use a protected work without permission in a way that violates the owner's exclusive rights.

Direct (Primary) Infringement:
- Occurs when someone:
  - Copies the work.
  - Stores it digitally (scan, fax, disk storage).
  - Issues copies to the public.
  - Performs or displays it publicly.
  - Uploads or shares it online.
  - Makes adaptations or modifications.

Key Principle:
- Copying "a whole or a substantial part" is infringement.
- There is no fixed percentage; even a small but important portion can qualify.

Secondary Infringement
----------------------
Secondary infringement happens when a person supports, enables, or benefits from someone else's direct infringement. It does not require copying the work personally.

Forms of Secondary Infringement:
- Importing or exporting pirated copies.
- Possessing or selling unauthorized copies.
- Providing tools or equipment used to make illegal copies.
- Allowing premises to be used for illegal performances.
- Hosting or enabling access to infringing digital content.

Why It Matters:
- Even if you did not copy the work yourself, assisting infringement can still be illegal.

Exceptions and Limitations (Fair Use / Fair Dealing Concepts)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Typical exceptions (varies by jurisdiction, summarized conceptually):
- Private study or research.
- Criticism, review, or news reporting (with acknowledgment).
- Educational use in limited circumstances.
- Technical copies made as part of network operations or caching.

Key idea:
- Exceptions are narrow and context-specific; they do not allow unrestricted copying.

Trademarks – Overview
---------------------
- Trademarks identify the source of goods or services.
- They help consumers recognize brands and prevent confusion in the marketplace.

What Trademarks Protect:
- Names, logos, slogans.
- Distinctive shapes, colors, or packaging (trade dress).
- Sounds or other distinctive identifiers in some cases.

Trademark Functions:
- Indicates origin of goods or services.
- Guarantees consistent quality.
- Acts as a marketing tool and brand asset.

Trademarks in Tech and Software:
- App names.
- Software product logos and icons.
- Company names and domain names (often connected to trademark rights).

Patents – Overview
------------------
- Patents protect new inventions that are:
  - Novel.
  - Non-obvious (inventive).
  - Industrially applicable.

Types of Things Patents Can Cover:
- New processes or methods.
- New machines or devices.
- New products or compositions.
- Improvements to existing inventions.

Patents in Software and Tech:
- In many jurisdictions, pure software "as such" may not be patentable, but:
  - Software that provides a technical effect or improves computer performance can sometimes be patentable.

Trade Secrets – Overview
------------------------
- Protects confidential business information that gives a competitive advantage.

Examples:
- Proprietary algorithms.
- Source code not released publicly.
- Customer lists.
- Internal processes and strategies.

Requirements:
- Information must be secret.
- It must have commercial value because it is secret.
- The owner must take reasonable steps to keep it secret (NDAs, access controls, etc.).

Geographical Indications – Overview
-----------------------------------
- Signs used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation due to that origin.
- Not usually relevant to software, but important for:
  - Agricultural products.
  - Handicrafts.
  - Regional foods.

International and National IP Framework (Overview)
--------------------------------------------------

Major International Treaties:
- Paris Convention – industrial property (patents, trademarks, designs).
- Berne Convention – literary and artistic works (copyright).
- Universal Copyright Convention – international copyright harmonization.
- TRIPS Agreement (WTO) – minimum global IP standards.
- WIPO Treaties – various specialized IP agreements.

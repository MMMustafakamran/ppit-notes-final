### Lecture 20 – Intellectual Property (Summary)

#### 1. Property and Why IP Is Different
- **Tangible vs intangible**:
  - Tangible: physical objects (phone, laptop, book) protected by normal theft/damage laws.
  - Intangible: creations of the mind (code, formulas, designs, brands) protected by **IP laws**.
- **Key difference**: intangible property can be copied without losing the original; value lies in **knowledge/expression**, not the physical medium → needs special legal protection.

#### 2. What Is Intellectual Property?
- **IP = creations of the mind**, such as:
  - Software and source code, documentation, UI.
  - Literary, artistic, musical and audiovisual works.
  - Scientific/technical designs, inventions, formulas.
  - Logos, symbols, brand identities, domain names.
- **Purpose of protection**:
  - Encourage creativity and innovation.
  - Give creators **exclusive rights** and the ability to license/sell.
  - Prevent unauthorized copying, modification, and misuse.

#### 3. Main Types of IP (with Tech Focus)
- **Copyright**
  - Protects **expression**, not ideas.
  - Covers: code, documentation, books, images, music, video, databases, websites, multimedia, e‑learning.
  - **Rights**: reproduction, distribution, public display, public performance, derivative works.
  - **Ownership**: usually the creator; employer if created in course of employment; can be assigned or licensed.
  - **Duration (Pakistan)**: life of author + 50 years; 50 years from publication for anonymous/corporate works.
- **Trademarks**
  - Protect **brand identifiers**: names, logos, slogans, icons, trade dress.
  - Functions: indicate origin, guarantee quality, support marketing.
  - Critical for app names, software logos, and company brands.
- **Patents**
  - Protect **new, inventive, industrially applicable inventions** (processes, machines, products, improvements).
  - In software: pure algorithms/business methods often **not patentable**; only technical‑effect solutions may qualify (depends on law).
- **Trade Secrets**
  - Protect confidential business information with commercial value.
  - Examples: proprietary algorithms, internal architecture, AI models, customer lists, pricing strategies.
  - Require **reasonable secrecy measures** (NDAs, access control); protection lasts as long as secrecy is kept.
- **Geographical Indications (GI)**
  - Signs for products whose qualities/reputation are tied to a place (e.g., Basmati, Darjeeling).
  - Important for food/handicrafts; not usually central to software.

#### 4. How One Software Product Uses Multiple IPs
- **Copyright** – code, docs, UI screens, website, media.
- **Patent** – novel algorithm, protocol, or technical process.
- **Trade Secret** – internal architecture, proprietary logic, AI model weights.
- **Trademark** – product name, logo, icon, app store branding.
- **Design protection** – visual design elements (icons, patterns, aesthetic layout).
> **Idea**: Combining these rights gives **layered protection** against cloning and unfair competition.

#### 5. Protecting a Startup or FYP
- Use **copyright** automatically for code and content.
- Consider **patent** if there is a truly novel technical solution (check patentability).
- Keep some elements as **trade secrets** (architecture, tuning, internal tools).
- Register a **trademark** early for the product/company name and logo.

#### 6. Global and Pakistani IP Framework (High Level)
- **International baseline**:
  - Paris Convention (industrial property), Berne Convention (copyright), TRIPS (WTO), WIPO treaties.
- **Pakistan’s main IP laws**:
  - Copyright Ordinance 1962.
  - Patents Ordinance 2000.
  - Trade Marks Ordinance 2001.
  - Registered Designs Ordinance 2000.
  - Layout‑Designs of Integrated Circuits Ordinance 2000.
  - GI (Registration & Protection) Act 2020.
  - Administered by **IPO‑Pakistan**.
- **International protection for startups**:
  - Copyright: automatic globally (Berne).
  - Patents: file in each country or via **PCT**; no global patent.
  - Trademarks: national filings or **Madrid Protocol**.
  - Designs: national filings (Pakistan not in Hague System).
  - Trade secrets: protected via contracts and secrecy, not registration.

> **Exam/Project takeaway:** Be able to match **each IP right** (copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, GI) to **what it protects, how long it lasts, and how it applies to software/startups**, and understand that multiple IP tools should be combined for strong protection.

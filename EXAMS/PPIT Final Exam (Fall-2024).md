### Question 2 [25 Marks]

**Ethical Decision Making - 4 Step Process**  
**Scenario: An E-Mail-Based Effort to Boost Morale Backfires**

*The Qaswa Corporation had a reputation for manufacturing heavy-duty trucks. Its 18-wheeler Truck Division was very successful. For many years, it sustained the corporation by its aggressive marketing overseas.*

*During the late 2000s and early 2010s, however, it experienced decreased orders. Because Qaswa was so dependent on its revenues, management was faced with the task of significantly reducing the workforce. The Board of Directors of Qaswa had never experienced such tough economic times. The directors issued a memorandum, which called for a reorganization to reduce the payroll in each division by 10 percent over a six-month period.*

*The severity and speed of the cut left little room for compromise. In some departments, workers were laid off without consideration of the value or length of their service at Qaswa. The drastic downsizing was certain to cause resentment and ill will.*

*At Qaswa's world headquarters in Islamabad, Pakistan, Khalid Khan worked as a software engineer. He designed and installed graphics modelling programs. His department had suffered its share of cuts, and it seemed to everyone that the workload was greater than ever. Employee morale was at an all-time low.*

*In Khalid's eyes, what his department needed was a good laugh, preferably at the company's expense. Maybe that would boost morale. He approached the department's test data designer, Maryam Chaudhry, who was his closest friend and confidante. He told her about his idea for distributing a document that would be good for a laugh. Maryam thought it was a grand idea and even offered to help, but Khalid said he preferred to work alone.*

*Khalid spent an entire evening at his terminal, composing a memo mocking the reorganization. This memo poked fun at the upper levels of management and contained some slang four-letter words. After composing the memo and signing it "Management," Khalid distributed it through e-mail to all workers in the department. Due to his knowledge of software engineering, he could bypass the system security software and send the memo anonymously.*

*The effect of the memo was immediate. Several people in Khalid's department e-mailed it to other departments, and it travelled throughout the company. It was the sole topic of conversation at all gatherings. People laughed at some phrasings and wandered from one office to another to share discovered double meanings. A few workers blushed at some of the words, and some said, "I just don't find it funny." But because so many co-workers enjoyed it, Khalid sensed success.*

*When asked who wrote it, however, he said he didn't know. Maryam also said nothing, though of course she knew who had written it. The memo was reprinted and copied, and it continued to spread like fire in dry grass.*

*Eventually, the division director, Shahzeb Shaukat, got a copy. He didn't like the memo at all. It was difficult enough to reduce the size of the division without what he called "this kind of insensitive criticism." Shahzeb promptly ordered technicians to identify the workstation from which the memo originated. They had no difficulty identifying the source, and when he confronted Khalid, he freely admitted his actions.*

*Shahzeb is concerned. Should he fire Khalid? Khalid's job is crucial to the division, and Shahzeb would be obliged to replace him immediately. However, Maryam Chaudhry could do Khalid's job, and this would be fortunate for Maryam because her position as test data designer is due to be eliminated by the reorganization.*
